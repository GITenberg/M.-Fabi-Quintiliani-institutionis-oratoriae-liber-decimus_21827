<p><span class = "smallcaps">This</span> volume has grown in my hands
during the last eighteen months. If I had contented myself with a short
commentary, it might have appeared sooner and in a slighter form. But in
addition to the full and careful illustration required for the matter of
Quintilian’s Tenth Book, the criticism of the text has become so
important as to call for separate treatment. It has engaged, within
recent years, a large share of the attention of some of the foremost
scholars on the Continent. Even while this volume was passing through
the press, fresh evidence of their continued activity was received in
the shape of two valuable papers&mdash;an article by Moriz Kiderlin in
one of the current numbers of the <i>Rheinisches Museum</i>, and
Becher’s ‘Zum zehnten Buch des Quintilianus’ in the <i>Programm des
Königlichen Gymnasiums zu Aurich</i> for Easter, 1891. The latter I have
found especially interesting, as confirming many of the conclusions at
which, with the help of one of the manuscripts in the British Museum
(Harl. 4995), I&nbsp;had arrived in regard to textual difficulties.</p>

<p>The importance ascribed to another English codex (Harl. 2664) will,
I&nbsp;venture to think, be held to be justified by the account of it
given in the Introduction. After I had examined it for myself, a
collation of it was kindly put at my disposal by Mr. L.&nbsp;C. Purser,
of Trinity College, Dublin, to whom I take this opportunity of rendering
my best thanks. I&nbsp;am indebted also to M.&nbsp;Ch.&nbsp;Fierville,
Censeur des études au Lycée Charlemagne, for sending me his collation of
four important Paris
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
manuscripts (Pratensis, Puteanus, 7231 and 7696), and also of the
Spanish Salmantinus. As to the other codices which I have been at the
trouble of collating personally, it will not be imagined that any
mistaken estimate has been formed of their value. If some of them throw
little fresh light on existing difficulties, they have each a bearing on
the history of the constitution of the text; and it seemed desirable to
complete, by some account of them, the elaborate description of the
Manuscripts of Quintilian given by M.&nbsp;Fierville in his latest
volume.</p>

<p>A reference to the list of authorities consulted will show the extent
of the obligations incurred to other editors and critics. Kruger’s third
edition has been especially useful. And though Professor Mayor’s
commentary extends only to the fifty-sixth section of the first chapter,
I&nbsp;trust I have profited by the example of scholarly thoroughness
which he set me in the part of the work which he was able to overtake.
His Analysis has also been largely followed.</p>

<p>For convenience of reference, a table of places has been added in
which the text of this edition differs from that of Halm and of Meister.
Special attention has been paid to the matter of punctuation, in regard
to which German methods have not been adopted.</p>

<p>One or two of my own conjectural emendations I have presumed to
insert in the text, and others are suggested in the Critical Notes.
Perhaps the most important is <i>sic dicere</i> for the MS.
<i>inicere</i> at 7 §29.</p>

<p>If my volume should strike any student as having been prepared on too
elaborate a scale, I&nbsp;trust it will be remembered that Quintilian is
a neglected author, for whom nothing has been done in this country (with
the exception of Professor Mayor’s incomplete edition of the Tenth Book)
since the beginning of the present century. Perhaps its publication may
help to clear the way for a final issue of the whole text of the
<i>Institutio</i>.</p>

CHAPTER I.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">
How to acquire a command of Diction.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec1">1-4.</a>
The question whether a ready command of speech is best acquired by
writing, or by reading, or by speaking, is of little practical
importance, all three being indispensable. But what is theoretically
most indispensable does not necessarily take first rank for the purpose
of practical oratory. Speaking comes first: then imitation (§8 and
ch.&nbsp;ii), including reading and hearing: lastly, writing (chs.
iii-v). That is the order of development&mdash;not necessarily the order
of importance. The early training of the orator has been overtaken in
the first two books. We have now to deal, not with the theory of
rhetoric, but with the best methods of applying theory to practice.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec5">5-15.</a>
The necessary store of <i>things</i> and <i>words</i> can be obtained
only by reading and hearing. We ought to read the best writings and hear
the best orators. And much reading and hearing will not only furnish a
stock of words: it will stimulate independent thought, and will show the
student actual examples of the theoretical principles taught in the
schools.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec16">16-19.</a>
The comparative advantages of hearing and reading: the former more
‘catching,’ the latter more independent.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec20">20-26.</a>
The best writers should be read first. Reading ought to be slow and
searching, with careful attention (especially in the case of speeches)
to details, followed by a review of the whole. We should also acquaint
ourselves with the facts of the cases to which the speeches relate, and
read those delivered on both sides. Other speeches on the same side
should be read, if accessible. But even in studying a masterpiece our
admiration must always be tempered with judgment: we cannot assume the
perfection of every part. It is safer, however, to err on the side of
appreciation: uncritical approbation is preferable to continual
fault-finding.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec27">27-30.</a>
The study of Poetry is important for the orator, as conferring a greater
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
elevation of spirit and diction, besides serving as a pleasurable
recreation. But poetry is not restrained by the practical aims of the
orator, whose stage is a battle-field where he must ever strive for the
mastery.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec31">31-34.</a>
History, too, will furnish a rich and genial aliment, which should be
used, however, with caution: its very excellences are often defects in
the orator. It tells its story, and recalls the past; whereas the orator
must address himself to immediate proof. Considered as a mine of ancient
precedents, history is very useful; but this point of view is rather
outside the scope of the present chapter.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec35">35-36.</a>
Philosophy will give familiarity with the principles of ethics and
dialectics, as well as skill in controversy. But here also we must bear
in mind that the atmosphere of the lecture-room differs from that of the
law-court.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec37">37-42.</a>
In laying down a plan of reading it would be impossible to notice
individually all the writers in both languages, though it may be said
generally that almost all, whether old or new, are worth
reading,&mdash;at least in part. There may be much that is valuable in
relation to some branch of knowledge, but outside my present object,
which is to recommend what is profitable for the formation of style.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec43">43-46.</a>
Before proceeding to give a list of typical authors, a&nbsp;word must be
said about the different opinions and tastes of orators and critics
regarding the various schools and styles of eloquence. Some are
prejudiced in favour of the old writers; others admire the affectation
and refinement which characterise those of our own day. And even those
who desire to follow the true standard of style differ among each other.
The list now to be given contains only a selection of the best models:
it does not profess to be exhaustive.</p>

<p>§§ 46-72. <span class = "smallcaps">Greek Poetry.</span></p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec46">§§ 46-61.</a>
<i>Epic, didactic, pastoral, elegiac, iambic, and lyric poetry
proper.</i></p>

<p>The praise of Homer, §§46-51: ‘it is much to understand, impossible
to rival, his greatness.’ Hesiod is rich in moral maxims, and a master
of the ‘middle style’: Antimachus, Panyasis, Apollonius, Aratus,
Theocritus, and others, §§52-57. A&nbsp;word in passing about the
elegiac poets, represented by Callimachus and Philetas, §58. Of
<i>iambographi</i> the typical writer is Archilochus, §§59-60. The chief
lyric poets are Pindar (§61), Stesichorus (§62), Alcaeus (§63), and
Simonides (§64).</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec65">§§ 65-72.</a>
<i>Dramatic poetry.</i></p>

<p>The Old Comedy (§§65-66) with its pure Attic diction and freedom of
political criticism is more akin to oratory and more fitted to form the
orator than any other class of poetry,&mdash;always excepting Homer.</p>

<p>Tragedy (§§67-68) is represented by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides: of the latter two Euripides is more useful for the orator. He
was imitated by Menander (§§69-72), the ‘mirror of life,’ who might
alone suffice to form the orator. Menander’s superiority to all other
comic dramatists.</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#commI_grk_hist">§§ 73-75.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Greek Historians.</span></p>

<p>The pregnant brevity of Thucydides, the charm and transparency of
Herodotus. Theopompus: Philistus (‘the little Thucydides’): Ephorus, and
others.</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#commI_grk_orat">§§ 76-80.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Greek Orators.</span></p>

<p>Demosthenes the standard of eloquence, in whom there is nothing
either too
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
much or too little. Aeschines more diffuse: ‘more flesh, less muscle.’
Hyperides is pleasing, but more at home in less important causes. Lysias
resembles a clear spring rather than a full river. Isocrates belongs to
the gymnasium rather than to the field of battle: in arrangement
punctilious to a fault. Demetrius of Phalerum the last Athenian worthy
of the name of orator.</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#commI_grk_phil">§§ 81-84.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Greek Philosophers.</span></p>

<p>Both in respect of reasoning power and for beauty of style, Plato
holds the first place. Of Xenophon’s artless charm it might be said that
‘Persuasion herself perched upon his lips.’ Aristotle is famous alike
for knowledge, productiveness, grace of style, invention, and
versatility. Theophrastus owed even his name to the divine splendour of
his language. The Stoics were the champions of virtue, and showed their
strength in defending their tenets: the grand style they did not
affect.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec85">85-92.</a>
<i>Epic Poets.</i></p>

<p>Vergil must head the list, ranking nearer to Homer than any third
poet does to him. For consistent and uniform excellence he may surpass
even Homer, however little he may rival Homer’s best passages. Macer and
Lucretius are worth reading, but not for style. Varro Atacinus has some
merit as a translator, but will not add to an orator’s resources. Ennius
is like some venerable grove, whose trees have more sanctity than
beauty: there are others nearer our own day, and more useful for our
special purpose. Ovid is uncontrolled even in his hexameters, and lets
his fancy run away with him: yet admirable in parts. Cornelius Severus
fell away from the standard of his first book. The youthful works of
Serranus display great talent and a correct taste in style. We lately
lost much in Valerius Flaccus. The inspiration of Saleius Bassus also
failed to take on the mellowness of age. Rabirius and Pedo are worth
reading in spare moments. Lucan has fire and point, and is a model for
orators rather than for poets. Domitian I would name had not the care of
the world prevented him from becoming our greatest poet. Even the
compositions of his earlier days, after he had handed over the empire,
are lofty, learned, and of surpassing excellence: ‘the poet’s ivy is
entwined with the conquering bay.’</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec93">93-96.</a>
<i>Elegy, Satire, iambic and lyric poetry.</i></p>

<p>In Elegy we can challenge the Greeks. The most polished and refined
is, in my opinion, Tibullus; some prefer Propertius. Ovid is more
uncontrolled than either, Gallus harsher. Satire is all our own.
Lucilius is by some still preferred to all poets whatsoever.
I&nbsp;deprecate such extravagant eulogy, as I disagree with the censure
of Horace. Lucilius has learning, boldness, causticity, wit. Horace is
the prince of satirists. Persius earned renown by a single book. Others
still alive will have a name hereafter. Terentius Varro wrote
<i>saturae</i> of the earlier kind. A&nbsp;profound scholar,
antiquarian, and historian, he has made greater contributions to
knowledge than to oratory. As a separate form of composition, iambic
poetry is not much in vogue. Horace is our great lyric
poet,&mdash;everywhere pleasing and graceful, and very happy in his
language. Caesius Bassus too may be added: but there are living authors
of greater merit.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec97">97-100.</a>
<i>Dramatic Poetry.</i></p>

<p>Of Tragedians, Attius and Pacuvius are most renowned for weight of
thought
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
and style, and for the dignity of their characters; but they lack
finish. Attius has more strength, Pacuvius more learning. Varius’s
<i>Thyestes</i> may be set beside any Greek play. Ovid’s <i>Medea</i>
shows what he might have done if he could have kept within bounds.
Pomponius Secundus is by far the greatest of all whom I have myself
seen. Comedy is not our strong point. Notwithstanding Plautus,
Caecilius, and Terence, we scarcely reproduce a faint shadow of our
originals: perhaps our language is incapable of the grace and charm
which, even in Greek, is peculiar to the Attic. Afranius is the best
writer of <i>togatae</i>, but his is not a pure art.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec101">101-104.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Roman Historians.</span></p>

<p>In history we hold our own. Sallust may be pitted against Thucydides,
Livy against Herodotus. Livy is remarkable for the charm and
transparency of his narrative style, as well as for the eloquence and
appropriateness of his speeches; and in the presentation of passion,
especially on its softer side, he is unsurpassed. Sallust is different
but not inferior. Servilius Nonianus wants conciseness. Aufidius Bassus
did more to maintain the dignity of history. There is also the glory of
our own age, the historian who is still with us, and whom I do not
mention by name. Cremutius Cordus is appreciated for his independent
spirit, which still survives in his works in spite of the revision and
expurgation they have been subjected to. There are others, but I am only
giving samples of classes, not ransacking libraries.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">105-122.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Roman Orators.</span></p>

<p>Cicero can stand against Demosthenes. I&nbsp;do not propose, however,
to make a detailed comparison between them, and I admit that Demosthenes
is worthy of being learnt by heart. In invention they resemble each
other: in style they differ, Demosthenes being more concise, Cicero more
diffuse; the one always pierces with the point of his weapon, the other
often lets you feel the weight of it; the one has more art, the other a
greater natural gift. In wit and pathos Cicero excels. Demosthenes was
perhaps debarred from glowing perorations; but on the other hand the
genius of the Latin language denies to us a full measure of the peculiar
‘Attic charm.’ Still Demosthenes came first, and Cicero owes much to
him. He is however no mere imitator,&mdash;‘no cistern of rain-water,
but a living source.’ Instructive, affecting, pleasing, he carries his
audience away with him. He wins conviction not by the zeal of a
partisan, but by the impartiality of a judge: everything he does is
natural and easy. He was king of the bar in his own day, and with us his
name is a synonym for eloquence: it is a mark of progress to have a high
appreciation of Cicero. Pollio, with all his good points, is so far
behind Cicero in charm and polish that it might be thought he lived a
century earlier. Messalla is lucid and distinguished, but wants force.
Caesar might have disputed the palm with Cicero; his speeches breathe
his warlike ardour, and yet he is above all things ‘elegans.’ Caelius
has genius and wit: he deserved a longer life. Calvus is by some
preferred to all others; but Cicero thought that by too rigorous
self-criticism he lost the very life-blood of style. He is moral,
weighty, chastened, and often vigorous withal. He was a strict Atticist;
and it is a pity that he died so young, if there was a likelihood of his
enriching his style. Servius Sulpicius made a name by three speeches.
Cassius Severus wants tone and dignity: he has genius, causticity, and
wit; but his anger outruns his judgment. Of those whom I have seen, Afer
and Africanus rank highest: the
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
former might be classed with the orators of former days, the latter is
more vigorous, but careless, wordy, and over-bold in metaphor. Trachalus
has elevation; he had great personal advantages as well. Vibius Crispus
is delightful, but more fitted for private than for public cases. Iulius
Secundus did not live long enough to secure his due share of fame. He is
too much of an artist and too little of a fighting-man: yet he has

<p>Though we are not strong in philosophy, yet here the universal Tully
is a match for Plato. Brutus, too, is greater here than in oratory: he
speaks from the heart. Celsus has written a considerable number of
works. Among the Stoics, Plautus will be of service to the inquirer.
Catius the Epicurean has no great weight, but is pleasant withal.
I&nbsp;might have mentioned Seneca before, and in every department, but
have purposely kept him waiting: I&nbsp;am accused of disliking him. The
fact is that at a time when he alone was studied I strove to introduce a
purer taste. He disparaged the ‘ancients,’ and his imitators aggravated
his defects. He possessed wide learning, though on special subjects he
was sometimes misled by others. His versatility is shown in oratory,
poetry, letters, and dialogues. A&nbsp;stern moralist, but a vicious,
yet seductive, stylist. His defects endear him to the young, but rob him
of the praise of those of riper years. Yet these too may find profit in
him, if they use their judgment. Would that he had had nobler aims! Yet
he realised the aims he had.</p>

Of Imitation.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec1">1-3.</a>
While the command of words, figures, and arrangement is to be acquired
by the study of the best authors, as recommended in the foregoing
chapter, the mind must also be exercised in the imitation of all the
good qualities which such authors exemplify. The place of imitation in
art: a&nbsp;natural and universal instinct. The very ease of imitation
has its dangers.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec4">4-13.</a>
Only a dull and sluggish spirit will be content to do nothing but
imitate, without inventing anything new. With our advantages of
training, we are even more bound than our predecessors to progress. We
ought even to surpass our models: if we confine ourselves to imitation
alone, shall we ever realise the ideal in oratory? Nature herself does
not achieve exact resemblance in reproduction. Moreover, there is much
in oratory that is characteristic of individual speakers, and due to
natural gifts: this cannot be made matter of imitation. You may imitate
the language and rhythmical arrangement of a great speech; but the
fashion of words changes, and as for arrangement, there must always be
an adaptation of sound to sense.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec14">14-18.</a>
Imitation is therefore a part of study in regard to which great
circumspection must be used,&mdash;first in the choice of models, and,
secondly, in determining
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
the good points we would seek to reproduce; for even good authors have
their defects. Again, we must know the difference between superficial
imitation and that in which the inner spirit is represented. In cases
where only the outward manner is caught elevation becomes bombast, and
simplicity carelessness; roughness of form and insipidity in substance
pass for antique plainness; want of polish and point, for Attic
restraint; artificial obscurity claims to rank above Sallust and
Thucydides; the dull and spiritless challenge comparison with Pollio;
easy-going drawlers call their diffuse periods Ciceronian, delighted if
they can finish off a sentence with <i>Esse videatur</i>.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec19">19-21.</a>
The student must consider which models his own gifts qualify him to
imitate. A&nbsp;bold rugged style, for example, is appropriate to the
form of genius which would make shipwreck by an excessive affectation of
refinement. It is of course within the province of the teacher to supply
the natural defects of his pupils; but it is a far harder matter to
mould and form one’s own nature. Even the teacher will not keep up a
prolonged struggle against obstacles of natural disposition.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec21">21-26.</a>
In oratory we ought not to imitate the characteristic qualities of poets
and historians, and <i>vice versa</i>: each kind of composition has its
own appropriate laws. Let us imitate what is common to eloquence in all
its manifestations. We must adapt our style to the topic and occasion:
even different parts of one and the same speech call for different
treatment. And we should not blindly follow any one model
exclusively.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec27">27-28.</a>
Imitation must not be confined to words only: we should study also
propriety, arrangement, exordium, narrative, argument, pathos, &amp;c.
The perfect orator, whom our age may hope to see, will be he who shall
unite all the good qualities of his predecessors and reject all the
bad.</p>

How to Write.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec1">1-4.</a>
<i>Introductory to the three chapters on Writing: chs. iii. and iv.
treating of the manner of writing</i> (quomodo), <i>and ch. v. of the
matter and form of writing</i> (quae maxime scribi oporteat §4). The pen
is the best teacher: write much and carefully. Writing is a fundamental
part of the orator’s training.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec5">5-18.</a>
As to the manner of writing, it should at first be deliberate and slow,
with careful attention alike to subject-matter, language, and the
arrangement of words and phrases. And the whole must be subjected to
careful revision, especially if it is written in a glow, as it were, of
inspiration. ‘Write quickly, and you will never write well; write well,
and in time you will write quickly.’ In the case of the orator it is
advisable gradually to accelerate the pace: he will never be able to
overtake his professional duties unless he gets rid of the habit of
carping self-criticism. Story of Iulius Florus. Judgment is also
necessary, as well as practice, if we are to write naturally and clearly
in any given circumstances. The
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
evil results of hasty composition can seldom be undone even by much
verbal correction. Your work should be done with so much care from the
first that it may need only to be filed and chiselled, not recast.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec19">19-27.</a>
Condemnation of the fashionable practice of dictating to an amanuensis.
He who writes for himself, no matter how rapidly, takes time to think;
but your scribe hurries you on, while shame forbids you to pause. Such
compositions reflect neither a writer’s care nor a speaker’s animation:
your one idea is to ‘keep going.’ Besides, an awkward scribe will check
the current of your thoughts. And how absurd it is to have him looking
on at the gestures which often accompany and stimulate the process of
cogitation! On the other hand, while silence and solitude are helpful,
rural seclusion and attractive scenery cannot be said to favour
concentration: closed doors are better. Night hours are the best, but
only in moderation.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec28">28-30.</a>
But solitude cannot always be secured: those who cannot command it must
habituate themselves to rise superior to every distraction. They who
only study when in the humour will never want an excuse for idleness. It
is possible to think, and to prepare for debate, in a crowd, on a jury,
and even amid the noise and confusion of the law-courts.</p>

But time is not always at command. There must obviously be some limit to
revision, especially on the part of the orator, who has to meet the
needs of the moment. Not all changes are improvements: let the file
polish the work, instead of rubbing it all away.</p>

What to Write.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec1">1-8.</a>
The question now, as distinguished from the preliminary courses laid
down in Books i. and ii., is what form of composition we should practise
in order to acquire copiousness and readiness. First, translation from
the Greek: this exercise leaves the writer free to choose the best terms
in his own language.
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
Second, reproduction (or paraphrase) of Latin poets and orators: here,
however, we often have to borrow from our models. Prose renderings of
the poets are especially useful for the formation of an elevated style.
And even in reproducing orations, we are stimulated to a kind of rivalry
with our author, which may result in our surpassing him: in any case,
the difficulty of competing with masterpieces forces us to study them
minutely.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec9">9-11.</a>
It will be of advantage also to put our own ideas into various forms of
expression, and to cultivate the faculty of amplifying: power is shown
in making much of little.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec11">11-16.</a>
Here the writing of <i>theses</i> (or discussions of abstract questions)
forms a valuable exercise: also judicial decisions and commonplaces. The
writing of declamations, or school speeches on fictitious cases, is also
to be recommended, even for those who are already making a name at the
bar. History, dialogue, and poetry are all valuable by way of variety
and recreation: a&nbsp;many-sided culture is the best safeguard against
such intellectual narrowness as would otherwise result from the daily
battles of the law-courts.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec17">17-20.</a>
Young students must not be kept too long at these preparatory exercises,
lest by indulging the fancy overmuch they unfit themselves for practice.
After a youth has been well schooled in <i>inventio</i> and
<i>elocutio</i>, and has had also some moderate amount of practice, he
should attach himself to some eminent public speaker, and accompany him
to the courts: he should write speeches, too, at home on the causes he
has heard. He has no longer to fence with foils.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec21">21-23.</a>
Declamations should resemble real speeches: the subject should be
treated naturally and thoroughly. Large classes and the custom of public
speech-days tend to encourage a specious showiness, in which only the
most popular and attractive parts of a subject are dealt with, and
crowded together without regard to logical connection. One subject,
thoroughly handled, is worth twenty superficially treated.</p>

Of Meditation.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVI_sec1">1-4.</a>
Meditation occupies the middle ground between writing and improvisation,
and is perhaps more frequently employed than either. <i>After</i> we
have formed our style by the constant practice of writing, meditation
can be cultivated by progressive exercise to such a degree that an
entire discourse may be prepared and arranged without the use of the
pen.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVI_sec5">5-7.</a>
But the orator is not to adhere so scrupulously to what he has thought
out as to reject new ideas which may flash upon him during the actual
delivery of a speech. Meditation should secure us, on the one hand, from
ever being at a loss: on the other it ought not to prevent us from
improving the opportunity afforded by some incidental occurrence. If we
are to hesitate, painfully recollecting what we have formulated in
thought, it were better to trust wholly to improvisation.
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
While we are at a loss to recall our prepared thoughts, we miss others
suggested by the subject itself, which always offers a wider field than
can possibly be covered by previous meditation.</p>

Of Extempore Speech.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec1">1-4.</a>
The richest fruit of study is the ability to speak effectively on the
spur of the moment: this is in fact absolutely indispensable. ‘An
advocate who proffers help, and fails at the pinch, is a harbour
accessible only in calm weather.’ Cases may take unforeseen turns: like
ship-pilots we must change our tack with each shifting breeze. Unless
the faculty of improvisation can be attained by practice, our years of
labour will have been wasted.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Certain Practical Exercises<br>
conducive to Success in Extempore Speech.</h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec5">5-7.</a>
(1) The student must arrange his matter in appropriate order,&mdash;not
only the order of the regular <i>partes</i> or divisions (i.e.
introduction, narrative, proof, refutation, conclusion), and the order
of the principal points, but also the order of the matter and thought in
all its detail, under every head and in every passage (quoque loco). The
sequence of events will be our guide. Knowing what to look for at each
point of our discourse, we shall not be found skipping from one topic to
another; and in the end we shall reach the goal.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec7">7-10.</a>
(2) Reading, writing, and speaking must receive unremitting attention,
and be made the subjects of scientific exercise. The conscientious
practice of writing will give even our extemporary speeches something of
the deliberate character of written compositions. It is practice that
makes the ready speaker. A&nbsp;certain natural quickness of mind is
necessary to look beyond what we are saying at the moment; but neither
nature nor art will enable the mind to keep before itself at one time
the whole of a speech, with all its arguments, arrangement, expression,
&amp;c. As our tongue advances, our thoughts must still outstrip it.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec11">11-14.</a>
(3) Hence the necessity of a mechanical and unscientific habit or
‘knack,’ such as that by which the hand moves in writing, the eye in
reading, and the juggler in his legerdemain. But this knack, though
mechanical, should have a basis of scientific method: otherwise it will
be mere ranting, such as you may hear in abundance from female scolds.
A&nbsp;sudden outburst is often, however, more effective than the result
of study and premeditation.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec15">15-17.</a>
(4) The extemporary speaker must cultivate a lively imagination, that
his mind may be deeply impressed by all the facts of a particular case.
It is the heart that makes the orator. He must also have distinctly in
view not only the end at which he aims but the whole pathway that leads
to it: he will derive incitement even from the presence of his
audience.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec18">18-23.</a>
(5) Extemporary facility can only be attained by the same gradual and
patient course as has been referred to in connection with meditation.
The orator is often debarred from preparation; but as a rule he should
not presume so far on his ability as not to take a moment to glance
mentally at the heads of his discourse,&mdash;which is generally
possible in a court of law. Some declaimers will argue at once on any
topic, and will even ask for a word to begin with: this is foolishness.
If on any occasion we are under the necessity of speaking offhand, we
should pay more attention to our subject-matter than to our language,
and we may gain time by deliberate articulation. Gradually we shall be
able to trim our sails, and pray for a favouring breeze.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec24">24-29.</a>
Continual practice is essential for improvisation. We should speak daily
before an audience whose good opinion we respect; but alone, rather than
not at all. If we do not speak to others, we can always at least go over
our subject-matter in silent thought. This fosters exactness in
composition even more than speaking aloud does; for there we hurry
onward from fear of wearying the audience. On the other hand speaking
exercises the voice and gives the opportunity of practising delivery.
Our language should always be careful and correct, but it is constant
writing that will add most weight to our words, especially if we are
obliged to speak much extempore. In fact, writing gives exactness to
speech, speech readiness to writing. If we cannot write, we can
meditate: if we can do neither, we must still contrive to make a
creditable appearance.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec30">30-33.</a>
A&nbsp;common habit with barristers in large practice is to write the
exordium and most essential parts, formulate the rest in thought, and
meet any unforeseen turns as they arise. The note-books of Cicero and
Servius Sulpicius. It is advisable to refresh one’s memory by consulting
notes. To prepare an abstract, arranged by heads, of a speech which we
have written out entire, leads us to rely too little on the memory, and
makes the speech broken and awkward in delivery. We ought not to write a
speech out at length unless we intend to commit it to memory. But of
memory more in the following book (XI. ch.&nbsp;ii.).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
