Life of Quintilian.</h5>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">It</span> would be possible to state in a
very few lines all that is certainly known about Quintilian’s personal
history; but much would remain to be said in order to convey an adequate
idea of the large place he must have filled in the era of which he is so
typical a representative. The period of his activity at Rome is nearly
co-extensive with the reign of the Flavian emperors,&mdash;Vespasian,
Titus, and Domitian. For twenty years he was the recognised head of the
teaching profession in the capital, and a large proportion of those who
came to maturity in the days of Trajan and Hadrian must have received
their intellectual training in his school. It is in itself a sign of the
tendencies of the age that Quintilian should have enjoyed the immediate
patronage of the reigning emperor in the conduct of work which would
formerly have attracted little notice. In earlier days the profession of
teaching had been held in low repute at Rome<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a>. The first attempt to open a
school of rhetoric, in <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> 94, was
looked on with the greatest suspicion and disfavour. Even Cicero adopts
a tone of apology in the rhetorical text-books which he wrote for the
instruction of others. But now all was changed, and education had come
to be, as it was in a still greater degree under Nerva, Trajan, and the
Antonines, a department of the government itself. Vespasian was the
founder of a new dynasty; and, though he had little culture to boast of
himself, he was shrewd enough to appreciate the advantages to be derived
from systematising the education of the Roman youth, and maintaining
friendly relations
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<a name = "intro_pageii" id = "intro_pageii"> </a>
with those to whom it was entrusted. Quintilian, for his part, seems to
have diligently seconded, in the scholastic sphere, his patron’s efforts
to efface the memory of the time of trouble and unrest which had
followed the extinction of the Julian line in the person of Nero. After
his retirement from the active duties of his profession, he received the
consular insignia from Domitian,&mdash;the promotion of a teacher of
rhetoric to the highest dignity in the State being regarded as a most
unexampled phenomenon by the conservative opinion of the day, which had
failed to recognise the significance of the alliance between prince and
pedagogue. The interest with which the publication of the <i>Institutio
Oratorio</i> was looked forward to, at the close of his laborious
professional career, is sufficient evidence of the authoritative
position Quintilian had gained for himself at Rome. It was a tribute not
only to the successful teacher, but also to the man of letters who,
conscious that his was an age of literary decadence, sought to probe the
causes of the national decline and to counteract its evil
influences.</p>

<p>Like so many of the distinguished men of his time, Quintilian was a
Spaniard by birth. There must have been something in the Spanish
national character that rendered the inhabitants of that country
peculiarly susceptible to the influences of Roman culture: certainly no
province assimilated more rapidly than Spain the civilisation of its
conquerors. The expansion of Rome may be clearly traced in the history
of her literature. Just as Italy, rather than the imperial city itself,
had supplied the court of Augustus with its chiefest literary ornaments,
so now Spain sends up to the centre of attraction for all things Roman a
band of authors united, if by nothing else, at least by the ties of a
common origin. Pomponius Mela is said to have come from a place called
Cingentera, on the bay of Algesiras; Columella was a native of Gades,
Martial of Bilbilis; the two Senecas and Lucan were born in Corduba. The
emperor Trajan came from Italica, near Seville; while Hadrian belonged
to a family which had long been settled there. Quintilian’s birthplace
was the town of Calagurris (Calahorra) on the Ebro, memorable in
previous history only for the resistance which it enabled Sertorius to
offer to Metellus and Pompeius: it was the last place that submitted
after the murder of the insurgent general in <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> 72.</p>

<p>In most of the older editions of Quintilian an anonymous Life
appears, the author of which (probably either Omnibonus Leonicenus or
Laurentius Valla) prefers a conjecture of his own to the ‘books of the
time,’ and makes out that Quintilian was born in Rome. His main argument
is that Martial does not include his name among those of the
distinguished authors to whom he refers as being of Spanish origin (e.g.
Epigr. i.
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<a name = "intro_pageiii" id = "intro_pageiii"> </a>
61 and 49), though he addresses him separately in complimentary terms
(Epigr. ii. 90). Against this we may set, however, the line in which
Ausonius embodies what was evidently a well-known and accepted tradition
(Prof. i.&nbsp;7):&mdash;</p>

<p class = "poem ital">Adserat usque licet Fabium Calagurris
alumnum;</p>

<p>and the statement of Hieronymus in the <i>Eusebian
Chronicle:&mdash;<ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Quinti/tilianus’ at line break">Quintilianus</ins>, ex Hispania
Calagurritanus, primus Romae publicam scholam</i> [<i>aperuit</i>]. The
latter extract carries additional weight if we accept the conjecture of
Reifferscheid<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> that Jerome here follows the authority of Suetonius
(Roth, p.&nbsp;272) in his work on the grammarians and rhetoricians.</p>

<p>The fact of Quintilian’s Spanish origin may therefore be regarded as
fully established, though we cannot cite the authority of Quintilian
himself on the subject. His removal to Rome, at a very early period of
his life, would naturally make him more of a Roman than a Spaniard; and
this is probably the reason why he nowhere refers to the accident of his
birth-place. Indeed his work does not lend itself to autobiographical
revelations. Most of his reminiscences, some of which occur in the Tenth
Book (<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec23">1&nbsp;§§23</a> and
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec86">86</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec12">3 §12</a>: cp. v. 7, 7: vi. 1,
14: xii. 11,&nbsp;3) are suggested by some detail connected with his
subject. Apart from the famous introduction to Book VI, where his grief
for the loss of his wife and two sons is allowed to interrupt the
continuity of his argument, he speaks of his father only once (ix.
3,&nbsp;73), and then simply to quote, not without some diffidence,
a&nbsp;<i>bon mot</i> of his in illustration of a figure of speech. The
father was himself a rhetorician, and seems to have taught the subject
both at Calagurris and also after the family removed to Rome: whether he
is identical with the Quintilianus mentioned as a declaimer of moderate
reputation by the elder Seneca (Controv. x. praef. 2: cp. ib.
33,&nbsp;19) cannot now be ascertained.</p>

<p>The date of Quintilian’s birth has been variously given as <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 42, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 38, and <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>
35, the last being now most commonly adopted. It cannot be determined
with certainty, though a few considerations may here be adduced to show
why it seems necessary to discard any theory that would put it after
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 38. Dodwell, in his ‘Annales
Quintilianei’ (see Burmann’s edition, vol. ii. p.&nbsp;1117), arrived at
the year <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 42, after a careful
examination of all the passages on which he thought it allowable to base
an inference. But Quintilian tells us himself that he was a young man
(<i>nobis adulescentibus</i> vi. 1,&nbsp;14) at the trial of Cossutianus
Capito,
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<a name = "intro_pageiv" id = "intro_pageiv"> </a>
which we know from Tacitus (Ann. xiii. 33) took place in <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 57: a fact which is in itself enough to show
that Dodwell is at least two years too late. Another indication is
derived from the references which Quintilian makes to his teacher
Domitius Afer, who is known to have died at a ripe old age in <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 59: cp. xii. 11, 3 <i>vidi ego ...
Domitium Afrum valde senem</i>: v. 7, 7 <i>quem adulescentulus senem
colui</i>: x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec86">1,&nbsp;86</a> <i>quae ex Afro
Domitio iuvenis excepi</i>. Unfortunately we do not know the date of the
trial of Volusenus Catulus referred to in x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec23">1,&nbsp;23</a>: Quintilian was a
boy at the time (<i>nobis pueris</i>). In the preface to Book VI he
writes like an old man: this appears especially in the reference he
makes to the wife whom he had lost and who was only
nineteen,&mdash;<i>aetate tam puellari praesertim meae comparata</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec5">§5</a>. If we may infer that
Quintilian was nearer sixty than fifty when he wrote these words, in
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 93 or 94, we may be certain that
he was born not later than <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 38,
and probably two or three years earlier.</p>

<p>Quintilian received his early education at Rome, and his father’s
position as a teacher of rhetoric, as well as the whole tendency of the
education of the day, no doubt gave it a rhetorical turn from the very
first. Even boys at school practised declamation, as may be seen from
the following passage of the <i>Institutio</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<i>Non inutilem scio servatum esse a praeceptoribus meis morem, qui
cum pueros in classes distribuerant, ordinem dicendi secundum vires
ingenii dabant; et ita superiore loco quisque declamabat ut praecedere
profectu videbatur. Huius rei iudicia praebebantur: ea nobis ingens
palma, ducere vero classem multo pulcherrimum. Nec de hoc semel decretum
erat: tricesimus dies reddebat victo certaminis potestatem. Ita nec
superior successu curam remittebat, et dolor victum ad depellendam
ignominiam concitabat. Id nobis acriores ad studia dicendi faces
subdidisse quam exhortationem docentium, paedagogorum custodiam, vota
parentium, quantum animi mei coniectura colligere possum,
contenderim.</i>’&mdash;i. 2, 23-25.</p>

<p>The same style of exercise was kept up at a later stage, when the boy
passed into the hands of a professed teacher of rhetoric, such as the
notorious Remmius Palaemon, who is said by the scholiast on Juvenal (vi.
451) to have been Quintilian’s master:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<i>Solebant praeceptores mei neque inutili et nobis etiam iucundo
genere exercitationis praeparare nos coniecturalibus causis, cum
quaerere atque exsequi iuberent “cur armata apud Lacedaemonios Venus” et
“quid ita crederetur Cupido puer atque volucer et sagittis ac face
armatus” et similia, in quibus scrutabamur voluntatem.</i>’&mdash;ii.
4,&nbsp;26.</p>

<p>He now came into contact with, and listened to the eloquence of, the
most celebrated orators of the day. In his relations with the greatest
of
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<a name = "intro_pagev" id = "intro_pagev"> </a>
these, Domitius Afer, Quintilian seems to have acted on the maxim which
he himself lays down for the budding advocate: <i>oratorem sibi aliquem,
quod apud maiores fieri solebat, deligat, quem sequatur, quem
imitetur</i> x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec19">5,&nbsp;19</a>. To Afer he
attached himself (<i>adsectabar Domitium Afrum</i> Plin. Ep. ii.
14,&nbsp;10), and was in all probability by him initiated in the
business of the law-courts and public life generally: cp. v. 7, 7
<i>adulescentulus senem colui</i> (<i>Domitium</i>). In this passage
Afer is said to have written two books on the examination of witnesses;
and from vi. 3, 42 it would appear that his ‘dicta’ or witticisms were
sufficiently distinguished to merit the honour of publication. He had
held high office under Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero, and his
pre-eminence at the bar was undisputed: xii. 11, 3 <i>principem fuisse
quondam fori non erat dubium</i>. In his review of Latin oratory,
Quintilian gives him high praise: <i>arte et toto genere dicendi
praeferendus, et quem in numero veterum habere non timeas</i> x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec118">1,&nbsp;118</a>. The pupil was
fortunate therefore in his master, and he drew upon his reminiscences of
Afer’s teaching when he himself came to instruct others (Plin. l.c.).
Among other notable orators of the day were Servilius Nonianus (x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec102">1,&nbsp;102</a>), Iulius
Africanus (x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec118">1,&nbsp;118</a>: xii.
10,&nbsp;11), Iulius Secundus (x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec120">1,&nbsp;120</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec12">3, 12</a>: xii. 10,&nbsp;11),
Galerius Trachalus (x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec119">1,&nbsp;119</a>: xii.
10,&nbsp;11), and Vibius Crispus (ibid.).</p>

<p>When he was about twenty-five years of age some motive induced
Quintilian to return to Calagurris, his native town; and there he spent
several years in the practice of his profession as teacher and
barrister. We know that he came back to Rome with Galba in <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 68: the evidence for this is again the
statement made by Hieronymus in the Eusebian Chronicle,
<i>M.&nbsp;Fabius Quintilianus Romam a Galba perducitur</i>. Galba had
been governor of Hispania Tarraconensis under Nero (<span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 61-68), and it is not improbable that
Quintilian, when he returned to his native country, was in some way
attached to his official retinue; the numerous <i>bons mots</i> which he
records in the third chapter of the Sixth Book (§§62, 64, 66,
80,&nbsp;90) seem to point to a certain amount of personal intercourse
between himself and the future emperor<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id
= "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a>.</p>

<p>At Rome Quintilian must soon have proved himself thoroughly qualified
for the work of teaching and training the young. The imperial
countenance afterwards shown him by Vespasian was in all probability
only an official expression of the esteem felt in the Roman community
for one who was serving with such distinction in a sphere of which the
importance was coming now to be more adequately recognised. Quintilian
was not only a learned man and a great teacher: he was a great
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagevi" id = "intro_pagevi"> </a>
moral power in the midst of a people which had long been demoralised by
the vices of its rulers. The fundamental principle of his teaching,
<i>non posse oratorem esse nisi virum bonum</i> (i. pr. §9 and
xii.&nbsp;1), shows the high ideal he cherished and the wide view he
took of the opportunities of his position. He felt himself strong enough
to make a protest against the literary influence of Seneca, then the
popular favourite, and to endeavour to recall a vitiated taste to more
rigorous standards: <i>corruptum et omnibus vitiis fractum dicendi genus
revocare ad severiora iudicia contendo</i> (x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec125">1,&nbsp;125</a>). And when, in
the evening of his days, he wrote his great treatise on the ‘technical
training’ of the orator, it was from himself and his own successful
practice that he drew many of his most cogent illustrations, e.g. vi. 2,
36, and (in regard to his powers of memory) xi. 2, 39 and iv.
2,&nbsp;86.</p>

<p>In the earlier years of his career at Rome, before he became absorbed
in the work of teaching, Quintilian must have had a considerable amount
of practice at the bar. He tells us himself of a speech which he
published, <i>ductus iuvenali cupiditate gloriae</i> viii. 2, 24. It was
of a common type. A&nbsp;certain Naevius Arpinianus was accused of
having killed his wife, who had fallen from a window; and we may infer
with certainty from the tone of Quintilian’s reference to the
circumstances of the case that he succeeded in securing the acquittal of
Naevius&mdash;more fortunate than the wife-killer of whom we read in
Tacitus (Ann. iv. 22). A&nbsp;more distinguished cause was that of
Berenice, the Jewish Queen before whom St.&nbsp;Paul appeared (Acts xxv.
13), and whose subsequent visit to Rome was connected with the
ascendency she had established over the heart of the youthful Titus
(Tac. Hist. ii. 2: Suet. Tit.&nbsp;7). We can only speculate on the
nature of the issue involved, as Quintilian confines himself to a bare
statement of fact&mdash;<i>ego pro regina Berenice apud ipsam causam
dixi</i> iv. 1, 19. It was in all probability a civil suit brought or
defended by Berenice against some Jewish countryman; and the phenomenon
of the queen herself presiding over a trial in which she was an
interested party is accounted for by the hypothesis that, at least in
civil suits, Roman tolerance allowed the Jews to settle their own
disputes according to their national law. On such occasions the person
of highest rank in the community to which the disputants belonged might
naturally be designated to preside over the tribunal<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagevii" id = "intro_pagevii"> </a>
<p>In another case, Quintilian seems to have shown some of the dexterity
attributed to him in the oft-quoted line of Juvenal (vi. 280) <i>Dic
aliquem, sodes, dic, Quintiliane, colorem</i>. He was counsel for a
woman who had been party to an arrangement by which the provisions of
the Voconian law (passed <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> 169 to
prevent the accumulation of property in the hands of females) had been
evaded by the not uncommon method of a fraudulent disposition to a third
person<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a>.
Quintilian’s client was accused of having produced a forged will. This
charge it was easy to rebut, though it rendered necessary the
explanation that the heirs named in the will had really undertaken to
hand the property over to the woman; and if this explanation were openly
given it would involve the loss of the estate. There is an evident tone
of satisfaction in Quintiiian’s description of what happened: <i>ita
ergo fuit nobis agendum ut iudices illud intellegerent factum, delatores
non possent adprehendere ut dictum, et contigit utrumque</i> (ix.
2,&nbsp;74).</p>

<p>Unlike his great model Cicero, who was considered most effective in
the <i>peroratio</i> of a great case, where the work was divided among
several pleaders, Quintilian was generally relied on to state a case
(<i>ponere causam</i>) in its main lines for subsequent elaboration:
<i>me certe, quantacunque nostris experimentis habenda est fides,
fecisse hoc in foro, quotiens ita desiderabat utilitas, probantibus et
eruditis et iis qui iudicabant, scio: et (quod non adroganter dixerim,
quia sunt plurimi quibuscum egi qui me refellere possint si mentiar)
fere a me ponendae causae officium exigebatur</i> iv. 2, 86. His
methodical habit of mind would render him specially effective for this
department of work. Other orators may have been more brilliant, more
full of fire, and more able to work upon the feelings of an audience: if
Quintilian had not the ‘grand style’&mdash;if he represents the type of
an orator that is ‘made’ rather than ‘born’&mdash;we may at least
believe that he was unsurpassed for judicious, moderate, and effective
statement. His model in this as in other matters was probably Domitius
Afer, of whom Pliny says (Ep.&nbsp;ii. 14,&nbsp;10) <i>apud decemviros
dicebat graviter et lente, hoc enim illi actionis genus erat</i>. His
character and training would secure him a place apart from the common
herd. ‘Among the orators of the day, some ignorant and coarse, having
left mean occupations, without any preliminary study, for the bar, where
they made up in audacity for lack of talent, and in noisy conceit for a
defective knowledge
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<a name = "intro_pageviii" id = "intro_pageviii"> </a>
of law&mdash;others trained in the practice of delation to every form of
trickery and violence&mdash;Quintilian, honest, able, and moderate stood
by himself<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a><ins class = "correction" title = "text has double quote">.’</ins></p>

<p>It was after Quintilian had attained some distinction in the practice
of his profession, probably in the year 72, that his activity became
invested with an official and public character. We learn the facts from
Suetonius’s Life of Vespasian (ch. 18): <i>primus e fisco latinis
graecisque rhetoribus annua centena constituit</i>: and the Eusebian
chronicle (see Roth’s Suetonius, p.&nbsp;272), <i>Quintilianus, ex
Hispania Calagurritanus, qui primus Romae publicam</i>
(‘state-supported’) <i>scholam</i> [<i>aperuit</i>] <i>et salarium e
fisco accepit, claruit</i>&mdash;the zenith of his fame being placed
between the years 85 and 89 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>
Vespasian, in fact, created and endowed a professorial Chair of
Rhetoric, and Quintilian was its first occupant. He thus became the
official head of the foremost school of oratory at Rome, and the
‘supreme controller of its restless youth’:</p>

<div class = "poem ital">
<p>Quintiliane, vagae moderator summe iuventae,</p>
<p>Gloria Romanae, Quintiliane, togae.
<span class = "plaintext">&mdash;Mart. ii. 90,&nbsp;1-2.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In this capacity he must have exercised the greatest possible
influence on the rising youth of Rome. The younger Pliny was his pupil,
and evidently retained a grateful memory of the instruction which he
received from him: Ep. ii. 14, 9 and vi. 6,&nbsp;3. The same is true, in
all probability, of Pliny’s friend Tacitus, who has much in common with
Quintilian: possibly also of Suetonius. If Juvenal was not actually his
pupil,&mdash;he is believed to have practised declamation till well on
in life,&mdash;we may infer from the complimentary references which
occur in his Satires that he at least appreciated Quintilian’s work and
recognised its healthy influence<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id =
"tag7" href = "#note7">7</a><ins class = "correction" title = "period missing">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>After a public career at Rome, extending over a period of twenty
years<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a>,
Quintilian definitely retired from both teaching and pleading at
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<a name = "intro_pageix" id = "intro_pageix"> </a>
the bar. He seems to have profited by the example of his model, Domitius
Afer, who would have done better if he had retired earlier (xii.
11,&nbsp;3): Quintilian thought it was well to go while he would still
be missed,&mdash;<i>et praecipiendi munus iam pridem deprecati sumus et
in foro quoque dicendi, quid honestissimum finem putabamus desinere dum
desideraremur</i>, ii. 12, 12. The wealth which he had acquired by the
practice of his profession (Juv. vii. 186-189) enabled him to go into
retirement with a light heart. The first-fruits of his leisure was a
treatise in which he sought to account for that decline in eloquence for
which the <i>Institutio Oratoria</i> was afterwards to provide a remedy.
It was entitled <i>De causis corruptae eloquentiae</i>, and was long
confounded with the Dialogue on Oratory, now ascribed to Tacitus: he
refers to this work in vi. pr. §3: viii. 6, 76: possibly also in ii. 4,
42: v. 12, 23: vi. pr. §3: viii. 3, 58, and 6, 76<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a>. This treatise is no longer
extant, and we have lost also the two books <i>Artis Rhetoricae</i>,
which were published under Quintilian’s name (1&nbsp;pr. §7), <i>neque
editi a me neque in hoc comparati: namque alterum sermonem per biduum
habitum pueri quibus id praestabatur exceperant, alterum pluribus sane

edition of the ‘Minor Declamations’ (M.&nbsp;Fabii Quintiliani
declamationes quae supersunt cxlv Lipsiae, 1884), Const. Ritter
endeavours to show that this is the work referred to in the passage
quoted above, from the preface to the <i>Institutio</i>: cp. Die

Tübingen, 1881, p. 246 sqq.<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11"
href = "#note11">11</a> Meister’s view, however, is that, like the
‘Greater Declamations,’ which are generally admitted to have been
composed at a later date, the ‘Minor Declamations’ also were written
subsequently either by Quintilian himself or (more probably) by
imitators who had caught his style and were glad to commend their
compositions by the aid of his great name. Even in his busy professional
days Quintilian had suffered from the zeal of pirate publishers: he
tells us (vii. 2,&nbsp;24) that several pleadings were in circulation
under his name which he could by no means claim as entirely his own:
<i>nam ceterae, quae sub nomine meo feruntur, neglegentia excipientium
in quaestum notariorum corruptae minimam partem mei habent</i>.</p>

<p>While living in retirement, and engaged on the composition of his
work, Quintilian received a fresh mark of Imperial favour, this time
from Domitian. This prince had adopted two grand-nephews, whom he
destined to succeed him on the throne,&mdash;the children of his niece
Flavia Domitilla, and of Flavius Clemens, a cousin whom he associated
with himself about this time in the duties of the consulship. They were
rechristened Vespasian and Domitian (Suet. Dom. 15), and the care of
their education was entrusted to Quintilian (<span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 93). He accepted it with fulsome expressions of
gratitude and appreciation<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12"
href = "#note12">12</a>; but did not exercise it for long<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13" id = "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a>, as the
children, with their parents, became the victims of the tyrant’s
capriciousness shortly before his murder, and were ruined as rapidly as
they had risen. Flavius Clemens was put to death, and his wife
Domitilla, probably accompanied by her two sons, was sent into exile.
They seem to have embraced the Jewish faith; and it is interesting to
speculate on the possibility that through intercourse with them, and
with their children, Quintilian may have come into contact with a
religion which was the forerunner of that which was destined soon
afterwards to achieve so universal a triumph.</p>

<p>It was while he was acting as tutor to the two princes that
Quintilian received, through the influence of their father Flavius
Clemens, the compliment of the consular insignia. This we learn from
Ausonius, himself the recipient of a similar favour from his pupil
Gratian: <i>Quintilianus per Clementem ornamenta consularia sortitus,
honestamenta nominis potius videtur quam insignia potestatis
habuisse</i>. It was probably in allusion to
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexi" id = "intro_pagexi"> </a>
this promotion, unexampled at that time in the case of a teacher of
rhetoric, that Juvenal wrote (vii. 197-8)&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem ital">
<p>Si Fortuna volet, fies de rhetore consul;</p>
<p>Si volet haec eadem, fies de consule rhetor:</p>
</div>

<p>while another parallel is chronicled by Pliny, Ep. iv. 11, 1
<i>praetorius hic modo ... nunc eo decidit ut exsul de senatore, rhetor
de oratore fieret. Itaque ipse in praefatione dixit dolenter el
graviter: ‘quos tibi Fortuna, ludos facis?’ facis enim ex professoribus
senatores, ex senatoribus professores.</i></p>

<p>The flattery with which Quintilian loads the emperor for these and
similar favours is the only stain on a character otherwise invariably
manly, honourable, and straightforward. It is startling for us to hear
that monster of iniquity, the last of the Flavian line, invoked as an
‘upright guardian of morals’ (<i>sanctissimus censor</i> iv. pr. §3),
even when he was ‘tearing in pieces the almost lifeless world.’ There
may have been a grain of sincerity in the compliments which Quintilian,
like Pliny, pays to his literary ability. Domitian’s poetical
productions are said not to have been altogether wanting in merit; and
his attachment to literary pursuits is shown by the festivals he
instituted in honour of Minerva and Jupiter Capitolinus, in which
rhetorical, musical, and artistic contests were a prominent feature (see
on x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec91">1,&nbsp;91</a>). But this is no
justification for the fulsome language employed by Quintilian in the
introduction to the Fourth Book, where the emperor is spoken of as the
protecting deity of literary men: <i>ut in omnibus ita in eloquentia
eminentissimum ... quo neque praesentius aliud nec studiis magis
propitium numen est</i>; nor for his profession of belief that nothing
but the cares of government prevented Domitian from becoming the
greatest poet of Rome: <i>Germanicum Augustum ab institutis studiis
deflexit cura terrarum, parumque dis visum est esse eum maximum
poetarum</i> x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec91">1,&nbsp;91</a> sq. Few would
recognise Domitian in the following reference: <i>laudandum in quibusdam
quod geniti immortales, quibusdam quod immortalitatem virtute sint
consecuti: quod pietas principis nostri praesentium quoque temporum
decus fecit</i> iii. 7,&nbsp;9. Such servility can only be partially
explained by Quintilian’s official relations to the Court and by the
circumstances of the time at which he wrote. It was a vice of the age:
Quintilian shares it with Martial, Statius, Silius Italicus, and
Valerius Flaccus. The indignant silence which Tacitus and Juvenal
maintained during the horrors of this reign is a better expression of
the virtue of old Rome, which seems to have burned with steadier flame
in the hearts of her genuine sons than in those of the ‘new men’
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexii" id = "intro_pagexii"> </a>
from the provinces, with neither pride of family nor pride of
nationality to save them from the corrupting influences of their
surroundings<a class = "tag" name = "tag14" id = "tag14" href =
"#note14">14</a>.</p>

<p>That Quintilian acquired considerable wealth, partly as a teacher and
partly by work at the bar, is evident from the pointed references made
by Juvenal in the seventh Satire. After showing how insignificant are
the fees paid by Roman parents for their children’s education, when
compared with their other expenses, the satirist suddenly breaks
off,&mdash;<i>unde igitur tot Quintilianus habet saltus?</i> How does it
come about (if his profession is so unremunerative) that Quintilian owns
so many estates? The only answer which Juvenal can give to this
conundrum is that the great teacher was one of the fortunate: ‘he is a
lucky man, and your lucky man, like Horace’s Stoic, unites every good
quality in himself, and can expect everything<a class = "tag" name =
"tag15" id = "tag15" href = "#note15">15</a>.’ We must remember however,
that, while Quintilian acquired wealth in the practice of his
profession, no charge is made against him as having placed his abilities
at the disposal of an unscrupulous ruler for his own advancement. Under
Nero, Marcellus Eprius assisted in procuring the condemnation of
Thrasea, and received over £42,000 for the service (Tac. Ann. xvi. 33):
if Quintilian’s name had ever been associated with such a trial, Juvenal
would have been more direct in his reference. But with Quintilian, as
with so many others, the advantages of position and fortune were
counterbalanced by grave domestic losses. In a less rhetorical age the
memorable introduction to the Sixth Book of the <i>Institutio</i> would
perhaps have taken a rather more simple form; but it is none the less a
testimony to the warm human heart of the writer, now a childless
widower. He had married, when already well on in life, a young girl
whose death at the early age of nineteen made him feel as if in her he
had lost a daughter rather than a wife: <i>cum omni virtute quae in
feminas cadit functa insanabilem attulit marito dolorem, tum aetate tam
puellari, praesertim meae comparata, potest et ipsa numerari inter
vulnera orbitatis</i> vi. pr.&nbsp;5. She left him two sons, the younger
of whom did not long survive her; he had just completed his fifth year
when he died. The father now concentrated all his affection
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexiii" id = "intro_pagexiii"> </a>
on the elder, and it was with his education in view that he made all
haste to complete his great work, which he considered would be the best
inheritance he could leave to him,&mdash;<i>hanc optimum partem
relicturus hereditatis videbar, ut si me, quod aequum et optabile fuit,
fata intercepissent, praeceptore tamen patre uteretur</i> ib. §1. But
the blow again descended, and his house was desolate: <i>at me fortuna
id agentem diebus ac noctibus festinantemque metu meae mortalitatis ita
subito prostravit ut laboris mei fructus ad neminem minus quam ad me
pertineret. Illum enim, de quo summa conceperam et in quo spem unicam
senectutis reponebam, repetito vulnere orbitatis amisi</i> ib. §2.</p>

<p>This would be about the year 94 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>, and the <i>Institutio Oratoria</i> is said to
have seen the light in 95. After that we hear no more of Quintilian.
Domitian was assassinated in 96, and under the new <i>régime</i> it is
possible that the favourite of the Flavian emperors may have been under
a cloud. But his work was done; even if he lived on for a few years
longer in retirement, his career had virtually closed with the
publication of his great treatise. It used to be believed that he lived
into the reign of Hadrian, and died about 118 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>, but this idea is founded on a misconception<a
class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href = "#note16">16</a>.
Probably he did not even see the accession of Nerva in 96: if he did, he
must have died soon afterwards, for there are two letters of Pliny’s
(one written between 97 and 100, and the other about 105) in which Pliny
does not speak of his old teacher as of one still alive.</p>

The Institutio Oratoria.</h5>

<p>Though Quintilian spent little more than two years on the composition
of the <i>Institutio Oratorio</i>, his work really embodies the
experience of a
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexiv" id = "intro_pagexiv"> </a>
lifetime. No doubt much of it lay ready to his hand, even before he
began to write, and he would willingly have kept it longer; but the
solicitations of Trypho, the publisher, were too much for him. His
letter to Trypho shows that he fully appreciated the magnitude of his
task; and there is even the suggestion that (like many a busy teacher
since his time) he only realised when called upon to publish that he had
not covered the whole ground of his subject<a class = "tag" name =
"tag17" id = "tag17" href = "#note17">17</a>. The opening words of the
introduction (<i>post impetratam studiis meis quietem, quae per viginti
annos erudiendis iuvenibus impenderam</i>, &amp;c.) show that the
<i>Institutio</i> was the work of his retirement: and various
indications lead us to fix the date of its composition as falling
between <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 93 and 95. The
introduction to the Fourth Book was evidently written when (probably in
93) Domitian had appointed Quintilian tutor to his grand-nephews; the
Sixth Book, where he refers to his family losses, must have followed
shortly afterwards; while the harshness of his references to the
philosophers in the concluding portions of the work (cp. xi. 1, 30, xii.
3, 11, with 1, pr. 15, which may have been written, or at least revised,
after the rest was finished) seems to suggest that their expulsion by
Domitian (in 94) was already an accomplished fact<a class = "tag" name =
"tag18" id = "tag18" href = "#note18">18</a>. The book is dedicated to
Victorius Marcellus, to whom Statius also addresses the Fourth Book of
his <i>Silvae</i>, evidently as to a person of some consideration and an
orator of repute (cp. Stat. Silv. iv. 4, 8, and 41 sq.). Marcellus had a
son called Geta (Inst. Or. i. pr. 6: Stat. Silv. iv. 4,&nbsp;71), and it
was originally with a view to the education of this youth (<i>erudiendo
Getae tuo</i>) that Quintilian associated the father’s name with his
work. Geta is again referred to, along with Quintilian’s elder son, and
also the grand-nephews of Domitian, in the introduction to the Fourth
Book; but the opening words of the Sixth Book show that they are all
gone, and the epilogue, at the conclusion of Book xii, is addressed to
Marcellus on behoof of ‘studiosi iuvenes’ in general.</p>

<p>The plan of the <i>Institutio Oratorio</i> cannot be better given
than in its author’s own words (i. pr. 21 sq.): <i>Liber primus ea quae
sunt ante officium rhetoris continebit. Secundo prima apud rhetorem
elementa et quae de ipsa rhetorices substantia quaeruntur tractabimus,
quinque deinceps inventioni (nam huic et dispositio subiungitur)
quattuor elocutioni, in cuius partem memoria ac pronuntiatio veniunt,
dabuntur. Unus accedet in quo nobis orator ipse informandus est, et qui
mores eius, quae in
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexv" id = "intro_pagexv"> </a>
suscipiendis, discendis, agendis causis ratio, quod eloquentiae genus,
quis agendi debeat esse finis, quae post finem studia, quantum nostra
valebit infirmitas, disseremus.</i> The first book deals with what the
pupil must learn before he goes to the rhetorician; it gives an account
of home-training and school discipline, and contains also a statement of
Quintilian’s views of grammar. The second book treats of rhetoric in
general: the choice of a proper instructor, as well as his character and
function, and the nature, principles, aims, and use of oratory. It is in
these early books especially that Quintilian reveals the high tone which
has made him an authority on educational morals, as well as rhetorical
training: see especially i. 2, 8, where he enlarges on Juvenal’s dictum,
<i>maxima debetur puero reverentia</i>; ii. 4, 10, where he advocates
gentle and conciliatory methods in teaching; and ii. 2, 5,&mdash;a
picture of the ideal teacher in language which might be applied to
Quintilian himself<a class = "tag" name = "tag19" id = "tag19" href =
"#note19">19</a>. The remaining books, except the twelfth, are devoted
to the five ‘parts of rhetoric,’&mdash;invention, arrangement, style,
memory, and delivery (Cic. de Inv. i. 7,&nbsp;9). In the third book we
have a classification of the different kinds of oratory. Next he treats
of the ‘different divisions of a speech, the purpose of the exordium,
the proper form of a statement of facts, what constitutes the force of
proofs, either in confirming our own assertions or refuting those of our
adversary, and of the different powers of the peroration, whether it be
regarded as a summary of the arguments previously used, or as a means of
exciting the feelings of the judge rather than of refreshing his
memory<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote misprinted after next footnote tag">.’</ins> This brings us to the end of the sixth book,
which closes with remarks on the uses of humour and of altercation<a
class = "tag" name = "tag20" id = "tag20" href = "#note20">20</a>. The
discussion of arrangement finishes with the seventh book, which is
extremely technical: style (<i>elocutio</i>) is the main subject of the
four books which follow. Of these the eighth and ninth treat of the
elements of a good style,&mdash;such as perspicuity, ornament, &amp;c.;
the tenth of the practical studies and exercises (including a course of
reading) by which the actual command of these elements may be obtained;
while the eleventh deals with appropriateness (i.e. the different kinds
of oratory which suit different audiences), memory, and delivery. The
twelfth book&mdash;which Quintilian calls the most grave and important
part of the whole work&mdash;treats of the high moral qualifications
requisite in the perfect orator:
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexvi" id = "intro_pagexvi"> </a>
just as the first book, introductory to the whole, describes the early
training which should precede the technical studies of the orator, so
the last book sets forth that ‘discipline of the whole man’ which is
their crown and conclusion<a class = "tag" name = "tag21" id = "tag21"
href = "#note21">21</a>. “Lastly, the experienced teacher gives advice
when the public life of an orator should begin, and when it should end.
Even then his activity will not come to an end. He will write the
history of his times, will explain the law to those who consult him,
will write, like Quintilian himself, a treatise on eloquence, or set
forth the highest principles of morality. The young men will throng
round and consult him as an oracle, and he will guide them as a pilot.
What can be more honourable to a man than to teach that of which he has
a thorough knowledge? ‘I know not,’ he concludes, ‘whether an orator
ought not to be thought happiest at that period of his life when,
sequestered from the world, devoted to retired study, unmolested by
envy, and remote from strife, he has placed his reputation in a harbour
of safety, experiencing while yet alive that respect which is more
commonly offered after death, and observing how his character will be
regarded by posterity<a class = "tag" name = "tag22" id = "tag22" href =
"#note22">22</a>.’”</p>


<p class = "space">
The <i>Institutio Oratoria</i> differs from all other previous
rhetorical treatises in the comprehensiveness of its aim and method. It
is a complete manual for the training of the orator, from his cradle to
the public platform. Founding on old Cato’s maxim, that the orator is
the <i>vir bonus dicendi peritus</i>, Quintilian considers it necessary
to take him at birth in order to secure the best results, as regards
both goodness of character and skill in speaking. His work has therefore
for us a double value and a twofold interest: it is a treatise on
education in general, and on rhetorical education in particular.
Throughout the whole, oratory is the end for the sake of which
everything is undertaken,&mdash;the goal to which the entire moral and
intellectual training of the student is to be directed. Quintilian’s
high conception of his subject is reflected in the language of the
‘Dialogue on Oratory’: <i>Studium quo non aliud in civitate nostra vel
ad utilitatem fructuosius vel ad voluptatem dulcius vel ad dignitatem
amplius vel ad urbis famam pulchrius vel ad totius imperii atque omnium
gentium notitiam inlustrius excogitari potest</i> (ch.&nbsp;5). Though
the field for the practical display of eloquence had been greatly
limited by
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexvii" id = "intro_pagexvii"> </a>
the extinction of the old freedom of political life, rhetoric
represented, in Quintilian’s day, the whole of education. It was to the
Romans what <span class = "greek" title = "mousikê">μουσική</span> was
to the Greeks, and was valued all the more by them because of its
eminently practical purpose. The student of rhetoric must therefore be
fully equipped. “Quintilian postulates the widest culture: there is no
form of knowledge from which something may not be extracted for his
purpose; and he is fully alive to the importance of method in education.
He ridicules the fashion of the day, which hurried over preliminary
cultivation, and allowed men to grow grey while declaiming in the
schools, where nature and reality were forgotten. Yet he develops all
the technicalities of rhetoric with a fulness to which we find no
parallel in ancient literature. Even in this portion of the work the
illustrations are so apposite and the style so dignified and yet sweet,
that the modern reader, whose initial interest in rhetoric is of
necessity faint, is carried along with much less fatigue than is
necessary to master most parts of the rhetorical writings of Aristotle
and Cicero. At all times the student feels that he is in the company of
a high-toned Roman gentleman who, so far as he could do without ceasing
to be a Roman, has taken up into his nature the best results of ancient
culture in all its forms<a class = "tag" name = "tag23" id = "tag23"
href = "#note23">23</a>.”</p>

<p>It is in connection with the general rather than with the technical
training of his pupils that Quintilian establishes a claim to rank with
the highest educational authorities,&mdash;as for example in his
insistence on the necessity of good example both at home<a class = "tag"
name = "tag24" id = "tag24" href = "#note24">24</a> and in school, and
on the respect due to the young<a class = "tag" name = "tag25" id =
"tag25" href = "#note25">25</a>, as well as his catalogue of the
qualifications required in the trainer of youth (ii. 2, 5: 4,&nbsp;10),
his protest against corporal punishment (i. 3,&nbsp;14), and his
consistent advocacy of the moral as well as the intellectual aspects of
education. His system was conceived as a remedy for the existing state
of things at Rome, where eloquence and the arts in general had, as
Messalla puts it in the ‘Dialogue on Oratory,’ “declined from their
ancient glory, not from the dearth of men, but from the indolence of the
young, the carelessness of parents, the ignorance of teachers, and
neglect of the old discipline<a class = "tag" name = "tag26" id =
"tag26" href = "#note26">26</a>.” Under it parents and teachers were to
be united in the effort to develop the moral and intellectual qualities
of the Roman youth: and through education the state was to recover
something of her old vigour and virtue.</p>

<p>The work was expected with the greatest interest before its
publication, and we may infer, from the high authority assigned to
Quintilian in the
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexviii" id = "intro_pagexviii"> </a>
literature of the period, that it long held an honoured place in Roman
schools. But it is curious that the earliest known references are not to
the <i>Institutio</i> but to the <i>Declamationes</i>. In an interesting
chapter of the Introduction to a recent volume<a class = "tag" name =
"tag27" id = "tag27" href = "#note27">27</a>, M.&nbsp;Fierville has
gathered together all the references that occur in the literature of the
early centuries of our era. Trebellius Pollio and Lactantius (both of
the 3rd century) speak of the Declamations, and Ausonius (4th century)
refers to Quintilian without naming his writings: the first definite
mention of the <i>Institutio</i> is made by Hilary of Poitiers (died
367) and afterwards by St.&nbsp;Jerome (died 420). Later Cassiodorus
(468-562) pronounced a eulogy which may stand as proof of his high
appreciation: <i>Quintilianus tamen doctor egregius, qui post fluvios
Tullianos singulariter valuit implere quae docuit, virum bonum dicendi
peritum a prima aetate suscipiens, per cunctas artes ac disciplinas
nobilium litterarum erudiendum esse monstravit, quem merito ad
defendendum totius civitatis vota requirerent</i> (de Arte
Rhetor.&mdash;Rhet. Lat. Min., ed. Halm, p.&nbsp;498). The Ars Rhetorica
of Julius Victor (6th century) is largely borrowed from Quintilian: see
Halm, praef. p.&nbsp;ix. Isidore, Bishop of Seville (570-630), studied
Quintilian in conjunction with Aristotle and Cicero. After the Dark Age,
Poggio’s discovery, at St.&nbsp;Gall in 1416, of a complete manuscript
of Quintilian was ranked as one of the most important literary events in
what we know now as the era of the Renaissance<a class = "tag" name =
"tag28" id = "tag28" href = "#note28">28</a>. The great scholars of the
fifteenth century worked hard at the emendation of the text. The
<i>editio princeps</i> was given to the world by G.&nbsp;A. Campani in
1470; and in the concluding words of his preface the editor reflects
something of the enthusiasm for his author which had already been
expressed by Petrarch, Poggio, and others,&mdash;<i>proinde de
Quintiliano sic habe, post unam beatissimam et unicam felicitatem
M.&nbsp;Tullii, quae fastigii loco suspicienda est omnibus et tamquam
adoranda, hunc unum esse quem praecipuum habere possis in eloquentia
ducem: quem si assequeris, quidquid tibi deerit ad cumulum
consummationis id a natura desiderabis non ab arte deposces</i>. This
edition was followed in rapid succession by various others, so that by
the end of the 16th century Quintilian had been edited a hundred times
over<a class = "tag" name = "tag29" id = "tag29" href =
"#note29">29</a>. The 17th century is not so rich in editions, but
Quintilian still reigned in the schools as the great master of rhetoric:
students of English literature
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexix" id = "intro_pagexix"> </a>
will remember how Milton (Sonnet xi) uses the authority of his name when
referring to the roughness of northern nomenclature:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>Those rugged names to our like mouths grow sleek</p>
<p>That would have made Quintilian stare and gasp.</p>
</div>

<p>In his ‘Tractate on Education’ too Milton strongly recommends the
first two or three books of the <i>Institutio</i>. The 18th century
provided the notable editions of Burmann (1720), Capperonier (1725),
Gesner (1738), and witnessed also the commencement of Spalding’s
(1798-1816), whose text, as revised by Zumpt and Bonnell, practically
held the field till the publication of Halm’s critical edition (1868).
Towards the close of last century it would appear that Quintilian was as
much studied as he had ever been,&mdash;probably by many who believed
in, as well as by some who would have rejected the application of the
maxim ‘<i>orator</i> nascitur non fit.’ William Pitt, for example,
shortly after his arrival at Cambridge (1773), and while ‘still bent on
his main object of oratorical excellence,’ attended a course of lectures
on Quintilian, which caused him on one occasion to interrupt his
correspondence with his father<a class = "tag" name = "tag30" id =
"tag30" href = "#note30">30</a>. His lasting popularity must have been
due, not only to his own intrinsic merits, but to the fact that his
writings harmonised well with the studies of those days: it was promoted
also by the serviceable abridgments of the <i>Institutio</i>, either in
whole or in part, that were from time to time published,&mdash;notably
that of Ch.&nbsp;Rollin in 1715. In our own day men whose education was
moulded on the old lines&mdash;such as J.&nbsp;S. Mill&mdash;considered
Quintilian an indispensable part of a scholar’s equipment. Macaulay read
him in India, along with the rest of classical literature. Lord
Beaconsfield professed that he was ‘very fond of Quintilian<a class =
"tag" name = "tag31" id = "tag31" href = "#note31">31</a>.’ But by our
classical scholars he has been almost entirely neglected, no complete
edition having appeared in this country since a revised text was issued
in London in 1822. German criticism, on the other hand, has of late paid
Quintilian special attention, with conspicuous results for the
emendation and illustration of his text: to the great names of Spalding,
Zumpt, and Bonnell, must be added those of Halm, Meister, Becher,
Wölfflin, and Kiderlin.</p>


<p class = "space">
Besides the literary criticism for which it has always attracted
attention, and which will form the subject of the next section, the
Tenth Book of the <i>Institutio</i> contains valuable precepts in regard
to various practical matters which are still of as great importance as
they were in Quintilian’s day. Among these are the practice of writing,
the use of an amanuensis,

Memoriales</span> (mainly taken from Krüger’s third edition, pp.

in the later chapters of the Tenth Book, Quintilian states his opinion
weightily and often with epigrammatic terseness:</p>

<h5><a name = "intro_chapIII" id = "intro_chapIII">III.</a>
Quintilians’s Litary Criticism.</h5>

<p>It was the conviction that a cultured orator is better than an orator
with no culture that induced Quintilian to devote so considerable a part
of the Tenth Book to a review of Greek and Roman literature. He was
aware that in order to speak with effect it is necessary for a man to
know a good deal that lies outside the scope of the particular case
which he may undertake to plead; and while the ‘firm facility’ <span
class = "greek" title = "hexis">ἕξις</span> at which he taught the
orator to aim could only be attained by a variety of exercises and
qualifications, a course of wide and careful reading must always, he
considered, form one of the factors in the combination.</p>

<p>In judging of the merits of Quintilian’s literary criticism we must
not forget the point of view from which he wrote. He is not dealing with
literature in and for itself. His was not the cast of mind in which the
faculty of literary appreciation finds artistic expression in the form
in which criticism becomes a part of literature itself. We cannot think
of the author of the Tenth Book of the <i>Institutio</i> as one whom a
divinely implanted instinct for literature impelled, towards the evening
of his days, to leave a record of the personal impressions he had
derived from contact with those whom we now recognise as the
master-minds of classical antiquity. Quintilian writes, not as the
literary man for a sympathetic brotherhood, but as the professor of
rhetoric for students in his school. If, in the
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxiii" id = "intro_pagexxiii"> </a>
course of his just and sober, but often trite and obvious criticisms, he
characterises a writer in language which has stood the test of time, it
is always when that writer touches his main interest most nearly, as one
from whom the student of style may learn much. In short, his work in the
department of literary criticism is done much in the same spirit as that
which, in these later days, has moved many sober and sensible, but on
the whole average persons, conversant with the general current of
contemporary thought, and not without the faculty of appreciative
discrimination, to draw up a list of the ‘Best Hundred Books.’ Their
aim, however, has been to guide and direct the work of that peculiar
product of modern times, the ‘general reader’: Quintilian’s victim was
the professed student of rhetoric.</p>

<p>But this limitation, arising partly out of the special aim which he
had imposed upon himself, partly, also, in all probability, from the
constitution of his own mind, ought not to blind us to the value of the
comprehensive review of ancient literature which Quintilian has left us
in this Tenth Book. “His literary sympathies are extraordinarily wide.
When obliged to condemn, as in the case of Seneca, he bestows generous
and even extravagant praise on such merit as he can find. He can
cordially admire even Sallust, the true fountain-head of the style which
he combats, while he will not suffer Lucilius to lie under the
aspersions of Horace.... The judgments which he passes may be in many
instances traditional, but, looking to all the circumstances of the
time, it seems remarkable that there should then have lived at Rome a
single man who could make them his own and give them expression. The
form in which these judgments are rendered is admirable. The gentle
justness of the sentiments is accompanied by a curious felicity of
phrase. Who can forget the ‘immortal swiftness of Sallust,’ or the
‘milky richness of Livy,’ or how ‘Horace soars now and then, and is full
of sweetness and grace, and in his varied forms and phrases is most
fortunately bold’? Ancient literary criticism perhaps touched its
highest points in the hands of Quintilian.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag32" id = "tag32" href = "#note32">32</a></p>

<p>The course of reading which Quintilian recommends is selected with
express reference to the aim which he had in view, and which is put
prominently forward in connection with nearly every individual
criticism. The young man who aspires to success in speaking must have
his taste formed: when he reads Homer, let him note that, great poet as
Homer is, and admirable in every respect, he is also <i>oratoria virtute
eminentissimus</i> (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec46">1&nbsp;§46</a>). Alcaeus is <i>plerumque
oratori similis</i> (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec63">1&nbsp;§63</a>): Euripides is, on that
ground, to be preferred to Sophocles (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec67">1&nbsp;§67</a>): Lucan is <i>magis
oratoribus quam poetis imitandus</i> (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec70">1&nbsp;§70</a>): and the old Greek comedy
is
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxiv" id = "intro_pagexxiv"> </a>
specially recommended as a form of poetry ‘than which probably none is
better suited to form the orator’ (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec65">1&nbsp;§65</a>). With the prose writers
Quintilian is thoroughly at home, and he nowhere lets in so much light
on his own sympathies as in the estimates he gives us of Cicero (<a href
= "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">1&nbsp;§§105-112</a>) and Seneca (<a
href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec125">1&nbsp;§§125-131</a>). His
criticism of Cicero is precisely what might have been expected from the
general tone of the references throughout the <i>Institutio</i>. Cicero
is Quintilian’s model, to whom he looks up with reverential admiration:
he will not hear of his faults. In his own day the great orator had been
attacked by Atticists of the severer type for the richness of his style
and the excessive attention which they alleged that he paid to rhythm.
The ‘plainness’ of Lysias was their ideal, and they failed to recognise
the fact that, with the more limited resources of the Latin language,
such simplicity and condensation would be perilously near to baldness
(cp. note on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">1&nbsp;§105</a>). Cicero they
regarded as an Asianist in disguise; in the words of his devoted
follower, they “dared to censure him as unduly turgid and Asiatic and
redundant; as too much given to repetition, and sometimes insipid in his
witticisms; and as spiritless, diffuse, and (save the mark!) even
effeminate in his arrangement” (<i>Inst. Or.</i> xii. 10, 12, quoted on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">1&nbsp;§105</a>). That this
criticism had not been forgotten in Quintilian’s own day is obvious not
only from the <i>Institutio</i> but also from the discussion in the
<i>Dialogus de Oratoribus</i>, where Aper is represented as saying “We
know that even Cicero was not without his disparagers, who thought him
inflated, turgid, not sufficiently concise, but unduly diffuse and
luxuriant, and far from Attic” (ch. 18). To such detractors of his great
model Quintilian will have nothing to say, and in his criticism of
Cicero he gives full expression to his enthusiastic admiration for the
genius of one who had brought eloquence to the highest pinnacle of
perfection (vi. 31 <i>Latinae eloquentiae princeps</i>: cp. x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">1&nbsp;§§105-112</a>: xii. 1,
20 <i>stetisse ipsum in fastigio eloquentiae fateor</i>: 10, 12 sqq.
<i>in omnibus quae in quoque laudantur eminentissimum</i>).</p>

<p>With such an absorbing enthusiasm for Cicero, it was hardly to be
expected that Quintilian would show an adequate appreciation of Seneca.
Seneca’s influence was the great obstacle in the way of a general return
to the classical tradition of the Golden Age, and this was the literary
reform which Quintilian had at heart&mdash;<i>corruptum et omnibus
vitiis fractum dicendi genus revocare ad severiora iudicia contendo</i>
x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec125">1,&nbsp;125</a>. It is probable
that, in spite of the appearance of candour which he assumes in dealing
with him, Quintilian approached Seneca with a certain degree of
prejudice<a class = "tag" name = "tag33" id = "tag33" href =
"#note33">33</a>. Quintilian represents the literature of erudition, and
his
<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxv" id = "intro_pagexxv"> </a>
standard is the best of what had been done in the past: Seneca was, like
Lucan, the child of a new era, to whom it seemed perfectly natural that
new thoughts should find utterance in new forms of expression. Seneca’s
motto was ‘nullius nomen fero,’&mdash;he gave free rein to the play of
his fancy, and rejected all method<a class = "tag" name = "tag34" id =
"tag34" href = "#note34">34</a>: Quintilian looked with horror (in the
interest of his pupils) on a liberty that was so near to licence, and
set himself to check it by recalling men’s minds to the ‘good old ways,’
and extolling Cicero as the synonym for eloquence itself. In such a
conflict of tastes as regards things literary, and apart from the
ambiguous character of Seneca’s personal career, it is not surprising
that Quintilian should have been unfavourably disposed towards him. He
had a grudge, moreover, against philosophers in general, especially the
Stoics. They had encroached on what his comprehensive scheme of
education impelled him to believe was the province of the teacher of
rhetoric,&mdash;the moral training of the future orator<a class = "tag"
name = "tag35" id = "tag35" href = "#note35">35</a>.</p>

<p>He was morbidly anxious to show that rhetoric stood in need of no
extraneous assistance: even the ‘grammatici’ he teaches to know their
proper place (see esp. i. 9,&nbsp;6). But it was mainly, no doubt, as
representing certain literary tendencies of which he disapproved that
Seneca must have incurred Quintilian’s censure. It is probable that in
many passages of the <i>Institutio</i>, where he is not specially named,
it is Seneca that is in the writer’s mind: the tone of the references
corresponds in several points with the famous passage of the Tenth
Book<a class = "tag" name = "tag36" id = "tag36" href =
"#note36">36</a>. In this passage
<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxvi" id = "intro_pagexxvi"> </a>
Quintilian is evidently putting forward the whole force of his authority
in order to counteract Seneca’s influence. He has kept him waiting in a
marked manner, to the very end of his literary review: and when he comes
to deal with him he does not confine his criticism to a few words or
phrases, but devotes nearly as much space to him as he did to Cicero
himself. In his estimate of Seneca nothing is more remarkable than the
careful manner in which Quintilian mingles praise and blame. But the
praise is reluctant and half-hearted: it is Seneca’s faults that his
critic wishes to make prominent. He admits his ability (<i>ingenium
facile et copiosum</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec128">§128</a>), and even goes the
length of saying that it would be well if his imitators could rise to
his level (<i>foret enim optandum pares ac saltem proximos illi viro
fieri</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec127">§127</a>). But praise is no
sooner given than it is immediately recalled. It was his faults that
secured imitators for Seneca (<i>placebat propter sola vitia</i> ib.);
if he was distinguished for wide knowledge (<i>plurimum studii, multa
rerum cognitio</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec128">§128</a>), he was often misled
by those who assisted him in his researches; if there is much that is
good in him, ‘much even to admire’ (<i>multa ... probanda in eo, multa
etiam admiranda sunt</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec131">§131</a>), still it requires
picking out. In short, so dangerous a model is he, that he should be
read only by those who have come to maturity, and then not so much,
evidently, for improvement, as for the reason that it is good to ‘see
both sides,’&mdash;<i>quod exercere potest utrimque iudicium</i>,
ib.</p>

<p>It has already been suggested that the secret of a great part of
Quintilian’s antipathy to Seneca may have been his dislike of the
philosophers, whom his imperial patrons found it necessary from time to
time to suppress. He was anxious to exalt rhetoric at the expense of
philosophy. But he was no doubt also honestly of opinion&mdash;and his
position as an instructor of youth would make him feel bound to express
his view distinctly&mdash;that Seneca was a dangerous model for the
budding orator to imitate. His merits were many and great: but his
peculiarities lent themselves readily to degradation. Quintilian wished
to put forward a counterblast to the fashionable tendency of the day,
and to recall&mdash;in their own interests&mdash;to severer models
Seneca’s youthful imitators,&mdash;those of whom he writes <i>ad ea</i>
(i.e. <i>eius vitia</i>) <i>se quisque dirigebat effingenda, quae
poterat; deinde quum se iactaret eodem modo dicere, Senecam
infamabat</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec127">§127</a>. Seneca was of course
not responsible for the exaggerations of his imitators, and Quintilian
would never have encouraged in his pupils exclusive devotion to any
particular model, especially if that model were characterised by such
peculiar features of style as distinguished Sallust or Tacitus. But he
could not forgive
<span class = "pagenum">xxvii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxvii" id = "intro_pagexxvii"> </a>
Seneca for his share in the reaction against Cicero<a class = "tag" name
= "tag37" id = "tag37" href = "#note37">37</a>. Admirers of Seneca think
that he failed to make allowance for the influences at work on the
philosopher’s style, and that he judged him too much from the standpoint
of a rhetorician. They admit Seneca’s faults&mdash;his tendency to
declamation, the want of balance in his style, his excessive subtlety,
his affectation, his want of method: but they contend that these faults
are compensated by still greater virtues<a class = "tag" name = "tag38"
id = "tag38" href = "#note38">38</a>. M.&nbsp;Rocheblave, who possesses
the appreciation of Seneca traditional among Frenchmen, follows Diderot
in inclining to believe that the philosopher was the victim of envy and
dislike<a class = "tag" name = "tag39" id = "tag39" href =
"#note39">39</a>. For himself he protests in the following terms against
what he considers the inadequacy of Quintilian’s estimate: ‘Da mihi
quemvis Annaei librorum ignarum, et dicito num ex istis Quintiliani
laudibus non modo perspicere, sed suspicari etiam possit quanto
sapientiae doctrinaeque gradu steterit scriptor qui in tota latina
facundia optima senserit, humanissima docuerit, maxima et multo plurima
excogitaverit, ita ut, multis ex antiqua morali philosophia seu graeca
seu latina depromptis, adiectis pluribus, potuerit in unum propriumque
saporem omnia illa quasi sapientiae humanae libamenta confundere?
Credisne a tali lectore scriptorem vivo gurgite exundantem, sensibus
scatentem, legentes in perpetuas rapientem cogitationes, eum denique
quem ob vim animi ingeniique acumen iure anteponat Tullio Montanius

laudes multum infra viri meritum stetisse (quod detrectationis sit

<p>Whether they were altogether deserved or not, there can be no doubt
<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>

that the strictures made by so great a literary leader as Quintilian was
in his own day must have greatly contributed to the overthrow of
Seneca’s influence. There is more than one indication, in the literature
of the next generation, that he is no longer regarded as a safe model
for imitation. Tacitus, in reporting the panegyric which Nero delivered
on Claudius after his death, and which was the work of Seneca, says that
it displayed much grace of style (<i>multum cultus</i>), as was to be
expected from one who possessed <i>ingenium amoenum et temporis</i> eius
<i>auribus accommodatum</i> (Ann. xiii.&nbsp;3). Suetonius tell us how
Caligula disparaged the <i>lenius comtiusque scribendi genus</i> which
Seneca represented; and here (Calig. 53) occurs a similar reference to a
fame that had passed away,&mdash;<i>Senecam <b>tum</b> maxime
placentem</i>, just as the elder Pliny, writing about the time of
Seneca’s death, speaks of him as <i>princeps <b>tum</b> eruditorum</i>
(Nat. Hist. xiv. 51). Later writers, such as Fronto and Aulus Gellius<a
class = "tag" name = "tag41" id = "tag41" href = "#note41">41</a> were
much more unreserved and even immoderate in their censure. And it is a
remarkable fact (noted by M.&nbsp;Rocheblave) that the name of the great
Stoic nowhere occurs in the writings of his successors, Epictetus and
Marcus Aurelius. He who had been the greatest literary ornament of
Nero’s reign disappears almost from notice in the second century.</p>

<p>In regard to the general body of Quintilian’s literary criticism, the
question of greatest interest for modern readers is the degree of its
originality. How far is Quintilian giving us his own independent
judgments on the writings of authors whom he had read at first hand? How
far is he merely registering current criticism, which must already have
found more or less definite expression in the writings and teaching of
previous rhetoricians and grammarians? The circumstances of the case
make it impossible for us to approach the special questions which it
involves with any great prejudice in favour of Quintilian’s originality
in general. The extent of his indebtedness to previous writers, as
regards the main body of his work, may be inferred from a glance at the
‘Index scriptorum et artificum’ in Halm’s edition. In many places he is
merely simplifying the rules of the Greek rhetoricians whom he followed.
Probably he was not equally well up in all the departments of the
subject of which he treats, and he naturally relied, to some extent, on
the works of those who had preceded him. But did he take his literary
criticism from others? Was Quintilian one of those reprehensible persons
who do not scruple to borrow, and to give forth as their own, the
estimate formed and expressed
<span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxix" id = "intro_pagexxix"> </a>
by some one else of authors whose works they may never themselves have
read?</p>

<p>In endeavouring to find an answer to this question, it will be
convenient to consider Quintilian’s criticism of the Greek writers apart
from that which he applies to his own countrymen, with whose works he
might <i>a&nbsp;priori</i> be expected to be more familiar. The notes to
that part of the Tenth Book in which he deals with Greek literature (<a
href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec46">1&nbsp;§§46-84</a>) will show too
many instances of parallelism for us to believe that, in addressing
himself to this portion of his subject, Quintilian scrupulously avoided
incurring any obligations to others<a class = "tag" name = "tag42" id =
"tag42" href = "#note42">42</a>. No doubt in his long career as a
teacher he had come into contact with traditional opinion as to the
merits and characteristics not only of the Greek but also of the Latin
writers; and in the two years which he tells us he devoted to the
composition of the <i>Institutio</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag43" id =
"tag43" href = "#note43">43</a> he may still further have increased his
debt to extraneous sources. It was in fact impossible that Quintilian
should have been unaware of the nature of the criticism current in his
own day, and of what had previously been said and written by others. But
he is not to be thought of as one who, before indicating his opinion of
a particular writer, carefully refers, not to that writer’s works, but
to the opinion of others concerning them. The cases in which he
reproduces, in very similar language, the verdict of others are not
always to be explained on the hypothesis of conscious borrowing<a class
= "tag" name = "tag44" id = "tag44" href = "#note44">44</a>. The
coincidences which can be traced certainly do detract from the
originality of his work.
<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxx" id = "intro_pagexxx"> </a>
But we do not need to believe that, in writing his individual
criticisms, Quintilian always had recourse to the works of others: he no
doubt had them at hand, and his career as a teacher had probably
impressed on his memory many <i>dicta</i> which he could hardly fail to
reproduce, in one form or another, when he came to gather together the
results of his teaching.</p>

<p>Literary criticism at Rome before Quintilian’s time is associated
mainly with the names of Varro, Cicero, and Horace<a class = "tag" name
= "tag45" id = "tag45" href = "#note45">45</a>. Varro was the author of
numerous works bearing on the history and criticism of literature: such
were his <i>de Poetis</i>, <i>de Poematis</i>, <span class = "greek"
title = "peri charaktêrôn">περὶ χαρακτήρων</span>, <i>de Actionibus
Scaenicis</i>, <i>Quaestiones Plautinae</i>. Our knowledge of their
scope and character is however derived only by inference from a few
scattered fragments, and in regard to these it is impossible to say
definitely to which of his treatises they severally belong. Quintilian’s
references to his literary activity as well as his great learning
(<i>vir Romanorum eruditissimus</i> x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec95">1,&nbsp;95</a>), and the
quotation of his estimate of Plautus (ib. §99), are sufficient evidence
that he was not unacquainted with Varro’s writings. Cicero he knew
probably better than he knew any other author: the extent of his
indebtedness to such works as the <i>Brutus</i> may be inferred from the
parallelisms which occur in his treatment of the Attic orators (x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec76">1,&nbsp;76-80</a>). He dissents
expressly from Horace’s estimate of Lucilius (ib. §94): and the
frequency of his references to other literary judgments of Horace (cp.
§§24, 56, 61, 63) shows that he must have been in the habit of
illustrating his teaching by quotations from the works of that cultured
critic of literature and life.</p>

<p>But the author with whom Quintilian’s literary criticism has most in
common is undoubtedly Dionysius of Halicarnassus. It is true that in the
Tenth Book he nowhere expressly mentions him; but references to him by
name as an authority on rhetorical matters are common enough in other
parts of the <i>Institutio</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag46" id =
"tag46" href = "#note46">46</a>. Quintilian no doubt knew his works
well, especially that which originally consisted of three books <span
class = "greek" title = "peri mimêseôs">περὶ μιμήσεως</span><a class =
"tag" name = "tag47" id = "tag47" href = "#note47">47</a>. The second
book of this treatise has long been known to scholars
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxxi" id = "intro_pagexxxi"> </a>
in the shape of a fragmentary epitome, which presents so many striking
resemblances to the literary judgments contained in the first chapter of
Quintilian’s Tenth Book, that early commentators, such as, for instance,
H.&nbsp;Stephanus, concluded that Quintilian had borrowed freely from
the earlier writer: <i>multa hinc etiam mutuatum constat; quibus modo
nomine suppresso pro suis utitur, modo addito verbo <b>putant</b> sua
non esse declarat</i>. The parallelisms in question were fully drawn out
by Claussen in the work mentioned above, though Usener justly remarks
that he wrongly includes a good deal that was the common property not
only of Dionysius and Quintilian, but of the whole learned world of the
day: they will all be found duly recorded in the notes to this edition,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec46">1&nbsp;§§46-84</a>.</p>

<p>The general resemblances between Quintilian and Dionysius are
apparent in their order of treatment. In his introduction to the
<i>Iudicium de Thucydide</i>, the latter sets forth the plan of his
second book in terms which present many points of analogy with the
scheme of the Tenth Book of the <i>Institutio</i>: <span class = "greek"

προελόμενον εἰς ἐλάχιστον ὄγκον συναγαγεῖν τὴν πραγματείαν.</span> In
like manner Quintilian, addressing himself throughout to young men
aspiring to success as public speakers, enumerates the various authors
who seem to be fit subjects for reading and imitation. While admitting
that some benefit may be derived from almost every writer (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec57">1&nbsp;§57</a>), he confines himself to
the most distinguished in the various departments of literature (<ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘45’"><a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec44">§44</a></ins> <i>paucos enim, qui sunt
eminentissimi, excerpere in animo est</i>); and even with regard to
these he warns his readers, as Dionysius does, that they are not to
imitate all their characteristics, but only what is good (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec24">1&nbsp;§24</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec14">2&nbsp;§§14-15</a>).</p>

<p>The order of treatment is almost identical in the two writers. First
come the poets, with the writers of epic poetry at their head: these are
not only named in the same order (Homer, Hesiod, Antimachus, Panyasis),
but they are commended in very similar terms. But if Quintilian had been
translating directly from Dionysius, it is very probable that he would
have mentioned him by name, instead of concealing his obligations
<span class = "pagenum">xxxii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxxii" id = "intro_pagexxxii"> </a>
by the use of such a phrase as <i>putant</i> (in speaking of
Panyasis&mdash;see note on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec54">§54</a>). If he goes on to add
some criticisms which are not in Dionysius, viz. on Apollonius Rhodius,
Aratus, Theocritus, and to mention also Pisander, Nicander, and
Euphorion, it is with the express intimation that they do not rank in
the canon fixed by the <i>grammatici</i>,&mdash;the very reason for
which these writers had been omitted by Dionysius. The Greek rhetorician
says nothing of the elegiac and iambic poets mentioned by
Quintilian,&mdash;the former in general terms (<i>princeps
<b>habetur</b> Callimachus</i>, <i>secundas <b>confessione
plurimorum</b> Philetas occupavit</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec58">§58</a>), the latter with
express reference to the judgment of Aristarchus on the great
Archilochus (<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec59">§59</a>)<a class =
"tag" name = "tag48" id = "tag48" href = "#note48">48</a>. In treating
of the lyric poets, Quintilian mentions the number nine (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec61">§61</a>), which Dionysius does not; but as
regards the substance of his criticisms, he is again almost in exact
agreement with his predecessor. Both refer to Pindar, Stesichorus,
Alcman, and Simonides, with the trifling difference that in Dionysius
Simonides comes second instead of fourth on the list. In
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec65">§65</a> Quintilian proceeds to
deal with the Old Comedy, which finds no place in the treatise of
Dionysius, as we now have it. And there is very little that corresponds
with Dionysius in the sections on Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.
But it is noticeable that in both Euripides is made to form the
transition to Menander and the New Comedy.</p>

<p>In regard to the poets, then, it seems probable that, while
Quintilian was no doubt familiar with the work of Dionysius, he is
rather incorporating in his criticism the traditions of the literary
schools than borrowing directly from a single predecessor. Claussen was
of opinion that the latter is the true state of the case, and he even
goes so far (p.&nbsp;348) as to suppose that the original work of
Dionysius (of which the treatise long known as the <span class = "greek"
title = "Archaiôn krisis">Ἀρχαίων κρίσις</span> or the <i>De Veterum
Censura</i> is only a fragmentary epitome) must have contained notices
of the elegiac and iambic poets corresponding with those in Quintilian,
as well as of the old comic dramatists and of additional representatives
of the New Comedy. But a comparison of the various passages on which a
judgment may be based seems to make it certain that, while taking
advantage of his knowledge of previous literary criticism (scraps of
which he may have accumulated for teaching purposes during his long
career), he is not slavishly following any single authority<a class =
"tag" name = "tag49" id = "tag49" href = "#note49">49</a>: cp.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec52">§52</a> <i>datur palma</i>
(<i>Hesiodo</i>,)
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxxiii" id = "intro_pagexxxiii"> </a>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec53">§53</a> <i>grammaticorum
consensus</i>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec54">§54</a> <i>ordinem a grammaticis

<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec58">§58</a> <i>princeps habetur</i>
and <i>confessione plurimorum</i>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec59">§59</a> <i>ex tribus receptis
Aristarchi iudicio scriptoribus iamborum</i>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec64">§64</a> <i>quidam</i> (probably
including Dionysius),
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec67">§67</a> <i>inter plurimos
quaeritur</i>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec72">§72</a> <i>consensu ...
omnium</i>. And the tone and substance of his estimate of Homer, of
Euripides, and of Menander<a class = "tag" name = "tag50" id = "tag50"
href = "#note50">50</a>, seem to show that he was prepared to rely, when
necessary, on his own independent judgment (cp. <i>meo quidem
iudicio</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec69">§69</a>), especially in dealing
with the poets who would be of greatest service for his professed
purpose.</p>

<p>In both Dionysius and Quintilian the poets are followed by the
historians. The order in Dionysius is Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon,
Philistus, and Theopompus; in Quintilian, Thucydides, Herodotus,
Theopompus, Philistus,&mdash;with short notices of Ephorus, Clitarchus
and Timagenes. The insertion of the three additional names, and the
precedence given to Theopompus, are not the only points in which
Quintilian differs here from Dionysius, who is known in this case to
have limited himself to the five names in question (Epist. ad Pomp.
767&nbsp;R: Usener, p.&nbsp;50, 10): Xenophon is by Quintilian expressly
postponed for treatment among the philosophers. In this he probably
followed an older tradition, which survived also elsewhere. Cicero
speaks of Xenophon as a philosopher (de Orat. ii. §58): in Diogenes
Laertius (ii. 48) it is said of him <span class = "greek" title = "alla kai historian philosophôn prôtos egrapse">ἀλλὰ καὶ ἱστορίαν φιλοσόφων
πρῶτος ἔγραψε</span>&mdash;a remark which Usener (p. 113) thinks was
probably derived from some library list in which Xenophon was ranked
among the writers of philosophy; and Dio Chrysostom (Or. xviii.) omits
him from his list of the historians, and includes him in that of the
Socratics.</p>

<p>These discrepancies may be relied on to disprove Claussen’s
allegation that Dionysius’s treatise is Quintilian’s <i>primus et
praecipuus fons</i>. It is quite as probable that, in dealing with the
historians, he had before him the passage in the second book of Cicero’s
<i>Orator</i>, to which reference has already been made (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec55">§55</a> sq.). There Cicero mentions
Herodotus, Thucydides, Philistus, Theopompus, and Ephorus, with the
addition of Xenophon, Callisthenes and Timaeus. He may also have had at
hand the great orator’s lost treatise <i>Hortensius</i>, two fragments
of which contain short characterisations of Herodotus, Thucydides,
Philistus, Theopompus, and Ephorus<a class = "tag" name = "tag51" id =
"tag51" href = "#note51">51</a>: in writing it Cicero probably followed
some list similar
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxxiv" id = "intro_pagexxxiv"> </a>
to those which were accessible both to Dionysius and Quintilian<a class
= "tag" name = "tag52" id = "tag52" href = "#note52">52</a>. Again there
is sufficient resemblance here between Quintilian and Dio Chrysostom (as
also in regard to Euripides and Menander: Dio Chr. 6, p.&nbsp;477 sq.)
to justify the supposition that they followed the same tradition. Dio
expressly elevates Theopompus to the second rank (10, p.&nbsp;479),
<span class = "greek" title = "tôn de akrôn Thoukudidês emoi dokei kai tôn deuterôn Theopompos; kai gar rhêtorikon ti peri tên apangelian tôn logôn echei">τῶν δὲ ἄκρων Θουκυδίδης ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ καὶ τῶν δευτέρων
Θεόπομπος‧ καὶ γὰρ ῥητορικόν τι περὶ τὴν ἀπαγγελίαν τῶν λόγων
ἔχει.</span>. With this compare Quintilian’s words: <i>Theopompus his
proximus ut in historia praedictis minor, ita oratori magis similis</i>
(<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec74">§74</a>). Ephorus, on the other
hand, is expressly eliminated by Dio.</p>

<p>It is perhaps in dealing with the orators that Quintilian gives the
surest proofs that he is not following any individual guide. The
parallel passages cited in the notes to
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec76">§§76-80</a> are by no means
confined to the writings of Dionysius, though here again words and
phrases occur (see esp. the note on <i>honesti studiosus, in
compositione adeo diligens</i>, &amp;c.,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec79">§79</a>) which seem to suggest
that Quintilian must have kept a common-place book into which he
‘conveyed’ points which struck him as just or appropriate in the
literary criticism of others<a class = "tag" name = "tag53" id = "tag53"
href = "#note53">53</a>. Unlike Dionysius, however, he refers to the
canon of the ten orators (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec76">§76</a>) which the recent work of Brzoska,
following A.&nbsp;Reifferscheid, has shown to have originated not with
the critics of Alexandria, but with those of Pergamum<a class = "tag"
name = "tag54" id = "tag54" href = "#note54">54</a>. It is noticeable
that the five orators whom Quintilian selects for notice out of this
canon are identical with those enumerated, in reverse order, by Cicero,
de Orat. iii. 28.</p>

<p>In their treatment of the philosophers, the chief point in common
between Dionysius and Quintilian is that both put Plato and Xenophon
before Aristotle. And, though they agree generally in the terms in which
they speak of Aristotle, there is no other noteworthy coincidence. The
section on Theophrastus and the Stoics has nothing corresponding to it
in Dionysius: here, as elsewhere in the account of philosophy, Cicero
was laid under contribution.</p>

<p>We may infer, then, on the whole, that in regard to his judgments of
the Greek writers Quintilian followed the established order of the
literary schools, and incorporated with the expression of his own
opinion much that was traditional in their thought and phraseology. He
cannot be supposed to have followed any single authority: he must rather
be considered to have gleaned in the whole field of the literature of
criticism from
<span class = "pagenum">xxxv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxxv" id = "intro_pagexxxv"> </a>
Theophrastus (x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec27">1,&nbsp;27</a>) down to his own
day. He accepted from others, with probably few modifications, the
approved lists of poets, historians, orators, and philosophers, and
adopted the conventional practice of writing careful and well-considered
criticisms upon them&mdash;“somewhat cut and dried criticisms,” as Prof.
Nettleship says of Dionysius, “which seldom lack sanity, care, and
insight, but which are rather dangerously suited for learning by heart
and handing on to future generations of pupils.” These lists of
‘classical’ writers may probably be traced back, in the main, to the
literary activity of the critics of Alexandria. They would no doubt be
well known to the Greek rhetoricians who were at work on the education
of the Roman youth as early as the beginning of the first century <span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, and may have served as the basis of
their prelections to their pupils. Criticism (<span class = "greek"
title = "krisis poiêmatôn, kritikê">κρίσις ποιημάτων, κριτικὴ</span>)
was an essential part of the office of the ‘grammaticus<a class = "tag"
name = "tag55" id = "tag55" href = "#note55">55</a>.’</p>

<p>In speaking of his duties, which fall under the two main heads of
<i>recte loquendi scientia</i> and <i>poetarum enarratio</i>, Quintilian
adds (i. 4,&nbsp;3): <i>et mixtum his omnibus <b>iudicium</b> est; quo
quidem ita severe sunt usi veteres grammatici ut non versus modo
censoria quadam virgula notare et libros, qui falso viderentur
inscripti, tamquam subditos submovere familia permiserint sibi, sed
auctores alios in ordinem redegerint, alios omnino exemerint numero</i>.
Beginning with a critical examination of individual texts, the
‘grammatici’ gathered up the results of their work, on the literary
side, in short characterisations of the various writers whom they made
the subject of their study, and finally drew up lists of the best
authors in each department of literature, with a careful indication of
their good points as well as of the features in which they were not to
be used as models. This process received a more or less final form at
the hands of Aristophanes of Byzantium and his follower Aristarchus (see
on x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec54">1,&nbsp;54</a>), the latter of
whom probably introduced such modifications in the list of his
predecessor as approved themselves to his own judgment (cp. x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec59">1,&nbsp;59</a> <i>tres receptos
<b>Aristarchi iudicio</b> scriptores iamborum</i>). The influence of
this method in Roman literature may be seen, early in the first century,
in the so-called ‘canon’ of Volcatius Sedigitus, preserved by Gellius
(15, 24)<a class = "tag" name = "tag56" id = "tag56" href =
"#note56">56</a>: he makes a list of ten Latin comedians, on the analogy
of the canon of the ten Attic orators. The list of the Alexandrine
critics was probably in the hands of Cicero, as Usener has shown (pp.
114-126), when he wrote his ‘Hortensius,’&mdash;a treatise which seems
to have originally contained an introductory sketch of the great
contributors to the various departments
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxxvi" id = "intro_pagexxxvi"> </a>
of literature, by way of preparation for the main purpose of the
dialogue,&mdash;the praise of philosophy<a class = "tag" name = "tag57"
id = "tag57" href = "#note57">57</a>. Then there is Dio Chrysostom, a
writer who flourished not long after Quintilian himself, and whose
reproduction of similar judgments has already been noted. Such
divergences as occur may probably be accounted for, at least in part, by
the different points of view from which the various critics wrote. In
the preliminary sketch in the <i>Hortensius</i> the object seems to have
been not the education of youth but the recreation of maturity: Dio
draws a careful distinction between the branches which serve for the
student of rhetoric, and those which may be expected to benefit and
delight men who have finished their studies: Quintilian’s aim, again and
again reiterated, is to lay down a course of reading suited to form the
taste of a young man aspiring to success as a speaker.</p>

<p>The probability that there existed such traditional lists as those
referred to (which would also be of service in the arrangement of the
great public libraries), is strikingly illustrated in Usener’s
<i>Epilogus</i> (p. 128 sq.) by the publication of one which may here be
transcribed as of great interest to readers of Quintilian. It will be
noticed that though the philosophers are omitted, it contains many
points of analogy with that followed by Quintilian, particularly the
addition of the later elegiac poets, Philetas and Callimachus. Names

<p>In regard to the historians, Usener notes that this list seems to
indicate the principle on which they were selected and arranged. They
are enumerated in pairs, Herodotus and Thucydides coming first, with
their imitators Xenophon and Philistus immediately following them. Then
come Theopompus and Ephorus, as representing the second rank; and next
the historians of Alexander’s victories, Anaximenes and Callisthenes
(cp. Cic. de Orat. ii. §58), in place of whom Clitarchus is mentioned by
Quintilian. Peculiar features about the list given above are that
Thucydides comes first of all (just as Demosthenes does among the
orators), and that, perhaps to make up the number ten, a fifth pair of
historians is added,&mdash;Hellanicus from those of older date, and
Polybius to represent more recent writers.</p>

<p>Usener states the conclusion at which he arrives in the following
words, which may be accepted with the proviso that they are not to be
taken as meaning that Quintilian was altogether ignorant of what
Dionysius wrote: <i>Iudicia de poetis scriptoribusque Graecis non a
Dionysio Quintilianus mutuatus est. Igitur ne Dionysius quidem sua
profert, sed diversum uterque exemplum iudiciorum ut plerumque
consonantium expressit. Fontis utrique communis antiquitatem Hortensius
Tullianus cum Dione comparatus demonstravit. Posteriore tempore cum
eruditionis copia in angustae memoriae paupertatem sensim contraheretur,
iudiciis neglectis sola electorum auctorum nomina relicta sunt et
laterculi formam induerunt.</i> Quintilian did not transcribe his
criticisms of Greek literature from Dionysius. He had no need to do so:
the materials from which Dionysius had drawn were available also to him.
This is sufficient to account for the resemblances in their critical
judgments. But on the other hand it is improbable that Quintilian, in
the course of his reading and teaching, had not studied the writings of
Dionysius; and some at least of the coincidences to which prominence is
given in the notes in this edition must have been the result of his
acquaintance with the work of his predecessor.</p>

<p>In his review of Latin literature, Quintilian is no doubt giving us
the fruit of his own study and independent judgment, though here again
the notes will indicate that he was familiar with what other writers,
such as Cicero and Horace, had said before in the way of literary
criticism. The examination of his estimate of Seneca has already proved
that he did not hesitate to formulate his own opinions, and to press
them, when
<span class = "pagenum">xxxviii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxxviii" id = "intro_pagexxxviii"> </a>
necessary, upon his pupils. A&nbsp;reference to the <i>Analysis</i>
(pp.&nbsp;3-5) will show that in this part of his work Quintilian
follows the method which had been traditionally applied to the criticism
of the Greek writers. The same order is preserved (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec85">§85</a>); the various departments of
literature are each compared with the corresponding departments in Greek
(<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec93">§§93</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec99">99</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec101">101</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">105</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec123">123</a>); and individual
writers are pitted against each other, and are sometimes characterised
in similar terms. In all this Quintilian is consistent with the scheme
according to which he had evidently determined to arrange his work: he
is consistent also with the general tradition of literary criticism
among his countrymen. “As Latin literature since Naevius had adopted
Greek models and Greek metres, every Latin writer of any pretensions
took some Greek author as his ideal of excellence in the particular
style which he was adopting. Criticism accordingly drifted into the
vicious course of comparison; of pitting every Latin writer against a
Greek writer, as though borrowing from a man would constitute you his
rival. Thus Ennius was a Homer, Afranius a Menander, Plautus an
Epicharmus, before the days of Horace: in Horace’s time there were three
Homers, Varius, Valgius, and Vergil. Cicero and Demosthenes were
compared by the Greek critics in the Augustan age, and by the time of
Quintilian Sallust has become the Latin Thucydides, Livy the Latin
Herodotus<a class = "tag" name = "tag59" id = "tag59" href =
"#note59">59</a>.” It is this idea of making ‘canons’ of Latin writers,
to correspond as nearly as possible with those which he had accepted
from former critics for the classical writers of Greece, that gives an
air of artificiality to Quintilian’s criticism of Latin literature, and
interferes somewhat with the general effect which his sane and sober
appreciations would otherwise produce. The individual estimates are in
the main all that could be wished for, notably the enthusiastic eulogy
of Cicero (<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">§§105-112</a>),
which it is interesting to compare with a similar passage in the
treatise ‘On the Sublime.’ “The same difference,” says the writer, “may
be discerned in the grandeur of Cicero as compared with that of his
Grecian rival. The sublimity of Demosthenes is generally sudden and
abrupt: that of Cicero is equally diffused. Demosthenes is vehement,
rapid, vigorous, terrible; he burns and sweeps away all before him; and
hence we may liken him to a whirlwind or a thunderbolt: Cicero is like a
widespread conflagration, which rolls over and feeds on all around it,
whose fire is extensive and burns long, breaking out successively in
different places, and finding its fuel now here, now there<a class =
"tag" name = "tag60" id = "tag60" href = "#note60">60</a>.” Excellent
also are the shorter characterisations of such writers as Sallust
(<i>immortalem Sallusti velocitatem</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec102">1&nbsp;§102</a>), of Livy
(<i>Livi lactea ubertas</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec32">1&nbsp;§32</a>: <i>mirae
iucunditatis clarissimique
<span class = "pagenum">xxxix</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexxxix" id = "intro_pagexxxix"> </a>
candoris</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec101">§101</a>), of Ovid (<i>nimium
amator ingenii sui</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec88">§88</a>), and of Horace (<i>et
insurgit aliquando et plenus est iucunditatis et gratiae et varius
figuris et verbis felicissime audax</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec96">§96</a>). But the general
impression we derive is that Quintilian is producing many of his
criticisms to order, as it were: so much is he tied down to the plan he
has adopted. It is to this same method of mechanical
comparison&mdash;born of the artificial traditions of the literary
schools&mdash;that we owe Plutarch’s ‘Parallel Lives’; and it has not
been without imitators in more recent times<a class = "tag" name =

<hr class = "mid">

<h5><a name = "intro_chapIV" id = "intro_chapIV">IV.</a>
Style and Language.</h5>

<p>Quintilian’s own style is pretty much what might be expected from the
tone of his judgments on others. Cicero was his model, Seneca
represented to him everything that was to be avoided: but the interval
of a hundred years which separated him from the former was a sufficient
barrier to anything more than an approximation to his style, while on
the other hand he does not succeed in emancipating himself entirely from
the literary tendencies of his own time, which found so complete
expression in the writings of Seneca. All the writers of what is known
as the Silver Age possess certain marked characteristics, which
differentiate them from the best models of the republican period; and of
these Quintilian has his share. But he did not fall in with the
fashionable depreciation of those models. He knew that it was impossible
to bring back the Latinity of the Golden Age in all its characteristic
features; but he could at least lift up his voice against the
affectation and artificiality of his contemporaries, who looked upon
that Latinity as tame, insipid, and commonplace. The point of view from
which, as we have already seen, he regarded Seneca may be stated with a
wider application: <i>corruptum et omnibus vitiis fractum dicendi genus
revocare ad severiora iudicia contendo</i>, x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec125">1,&nbsp;125</a>.</p>

<p>The depravation of taste which had gone hand in hand with the moral
and social degeneration of the Roman people, in the era of transition
from republic to empire, has already been touched upon in the discussion
<span class = "pagenum">xl</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexl" id = "intro_pagexl"> </a>
of Quintilian’s criticism of Seneca. The literary public had lost all
appetite for the natural straightforwardness of the Ciceronian style: it
craved for something akin to the highly seasoned dishes by which the
epicures of the day sought to stimulate a jaded palate<a class = "tag"
name = "tag62" id = "tag62" href = "#note62">62</a>. It was not enough
now to clothe the thought in pure, clear, and elegant language, even
when adorned by a wealth of expression that bordered on exuberance, and
made musical by the exquisite modulation of the period. No one could win
a hearing who did not countenance the fashionable craze for affectation,
abruptness, and extravagance. Directness, ease, and intelligibility were
no recommendations<a class = "tag" name = "tag63" id = "tag63" href =
"#note63">63</a>. In order to strike and stimulate, everything must be
full of point. Feebleness of thought was considered to be redeemed by
epigram and formal antithesis. The amplitude and artistic symmetry of
the Ciceronian period gave place to a broken and abrupt style, the main
object of which was to arrest attention and to challenge admiration.
Showy passages were looked for, expressed in new and striking
phraseology, such as could be reproduced and even handed on to others<a
class = "tag" name = "tag64" id = "tag64" href = "#note64">64</a>. The
charm of style and the test of its excellence consisted in its being
artificial, inflated, meretricious, involved, obscure&mdash;in a word,
depraved<a class = "tag" name = "tag65" id = "tag65" href =
"#note65">65</a>.</p>

<p>Quintilian’s distaste for the prevailing fashion inclined him to
return to the models of the best republican period. Exclusive devotion
to one particular type was forbidden him, if by nothing else, by his own
declared principles,&mdash;<i>non qui maxime imitandus et solus
imitandus est</i> (<a href =
"QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec24">2&nbsp;§24</a>); and accordingly, in
spite of his great admiration for Cicero, we find several well-marked
features of difference between him and his master, not only in the use
of words, but also in the structure and composition of sentences<a class
= "tag" name = "tag66" id = "tag66" href = "#note66">66</a>. Indeed, it
could not have been otherwise. Quintilian’s mission was to restore to
Latin composition the direct and natural character of the earlier style;
but he could not extirpate that tendency to poetical expression which
had taken root at Rome as far back as the
<span class = "pagenum">xli</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexli" id = "intro_pagexli"> </a>
days of Sallust, and was fostered and encouraged in his own time by the
wider study of Greek. He was conscious also of the need of making some
concessions to the popular demand for ornament. The power of the
‘sententious’ style proved itself even on its critic and antagonist.
That he was aware of the compromise he was making is clear from such a
passage as the following, in which he indicates how Cicero may be
adapted to contemporary requirements: <i>ad cuius (Ciceronis) voluptates
nihil equidem quod addi possit invenio, <b>nisi ut sensus nos quidem
dicamus plures</b>: nempe enim fieri potest salva tractatione causae et
dicendi auctoritate, si non crebra haec lumina et continua fuerint et
invicem offecerint. Sed me <b>hactenus cedentem</b> nemo insequatur
ultra</i>, &amp;c. (xii. 10, 46-7). There was a point beyond which he
refused to go: clearness and simplicity must never be sacrificed to
effect. These qualities may be claimed for Quintilian’s style; it is
also sufficiently varied for his subject. When it is obscure, we must
remember the defective state in which his text has come down to us<a

It is quite possible to exemplify from the Tenth Book alone the main
features in which Quintilian’s language and style differ from those of
Cicero. And first, in regard to his vocabulary, a list may be appended

<p>To these may be added the use of <i>subripere</i> (for <i>clam

The influence of poetical usage may be seen in the frequent employment
of simple verbs in the sense of compounds, of abstract nouns in a
concrete sense (e.g. <i>facilitatem</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec7">3&nbsp;§7</a>), and also in
certain changes in the meaning of words, each of which will be noticed
in its proper place: e.g. <i>componere</i> for <i>sedare</i>;
<i>vacare</i> used impersonally; <i>venus</i> for <i>venustas</i>;
<i>beatus</i> for <i>uber</i>, <i>fecundus</i>; <i>secretum</i>;
<i>olim</i> of future time; <i>utrimque</i> of opposite sides, &amp;c.
Such changes in meaning as will be noted in connection with words like
<i>valetudo</i>, <i>ambitio</i>, <i>advocatus</i>, <i>auctor</i>,
<i>cultus</i>, <i>quicumque</i>, <i>ubicumque</i>, <i>demum</i>, and all
the phenomena connected with the substantivation of the adjective (e.g.
<i>studiosus</i>), are common to Quintilian with other writers of the
Silver Age.</p>

Taking now the Parts of Speech in their order, we may illustrate the
peculiarities of Quintilian’s vocabulary by reference to the Tenth
Book.</p>

<h5>I. Nouns.</h5>

<p><b>Advocatus</b> for <i>causidicus</i>, <i>patronus</i>: x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec111">1,&nbsp;111</a> (where see
note): cp. iii. 8, 51; xi. 1, 59: Plin. S. 7, 22: Suet. Claud. 15. For
examples of the use of this word in its earlier sense cp. v. 6, 6; xi.
3, 132; xii. 3,&nbsp;2.</p>

<p><b>Ambitio</b> carries with it in Quintilian, as generally in the
Silver Age, a sinister meaning, so that Quintilian can call it a
<i>vitium</i>: i. 2, 22 <i>licet ipsa vitium sit ambitio frequenter
tamen causa virtutum est</i>. So <i>perversa ambitio</i> x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec21">7,&nbsp;21</a>: cp. Tac. Ann.
vi. 46: Iuv. 8, 135. For the Ciceronian use of the word (<i>popularis
gratiae captatio ad adipiscendos honores</i>), see pro Sulla §11: pro
Planc. §45: de Orat. i. §1.</p>

<p><b>Auctor</b>, almost identical with <i>scriptor</i>: see on x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec24">1,&nbsp;24</a>. Cp. Ep. ad
Tryph. §1 <i>legendis auctoribus qui sunt innumerabiles</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cultus</b> = <i>ornatus</i>: x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec124">1,&nbsp;124</a>;
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec17">2,&nbsp;17</a>. Cp. iii. 8, 58
<i>in verbis cultum adfectaverunt</i>: xi. 1, 58 <i>nitor et cultus</i>.
Cicero uses <i>ornatus</i> and <i>nitor</i> as applied to language:
Orat. §80 <i>ornatus verborum</i>, §13 4 <i>orationis</i>. Cp. Tac.
Dial. 20, 23.</p>

<p><b>Opinio</b> is used for ‘reputation’ (<i>existimatio</i>), whether
good or bad. So x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec18">5,&nbsp;18</a> (where see note):
7, 17: cp. xii. 1, 12 <i>contemptu opinionis</i>: ii. 12, 5 <i>adfert et
ista res opinionem</i>: ix. 2, 74 <i>veritus opinionem iactantiae</i>:
iv. 1, 33 <i>opinione adrogantiae laborare</i>: Tac. Dial. 10 <i>ne
opinio quidem et fama ... aeque poetas quam oratores sequitur</i>: Sen.
Ep. 79, 16. In Cicero it is found only with a genitive (ad Att. 7, 2
<i>opinio integritatis</i>: cp. Liv. xlv. 38, 6: Caes. B.G. vii. 59, 5:
Tac. Dial. 15), or with an adjective (Verr. ii. 3, 24 <i>falsam ...
malam opinionem</i>).</p>

<p><b>Opus</b> frequently means ‘branch,’ ‘department’ in Quintilian: x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec9">1,&nbsp;9</a> (where see note).
It is often identical with ‘genus’: e.g. x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec123">1,&nbsp;123</a> where they are
used together, <i>quo in genere&mdash;in hoc opere</i>. Cp. iii. 7, 28
<i>quamquam tres status omnes cadere in hoc opus (laudativum genus)
possint</i>.</p>

<p><b>Valetudo</b>, always in the sense of ‘bad health’ in Quintilian
and contemporary writers. If ‘good health’ is meant, an adjective is
used: e.g. x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec26">3,&nbsp;26</a> <i>bona
valetudo</i>: vi. 3, 77 <i>commodior valetudo</i>. With Cicero it may
mean either: de Fin. v. §84 <i>bonum valetudo, miser morbus</i>: de Am.
§8 <i>quod in collegio nostro non adfuisses, valetudinem respondeo
causam</i>: ad Fam. iv. 1, 1: in Tusc. iv. §80 he has <i>mala
valetudo</i>. With Quintilian’s usage cp. Tac. Hist. iii. 2; Ann. vi.
50: Suet. Claud. 26: Plin. S. 2,&nbsp;20.</p>

<p><b>Venus</b> for <i>venustas</i>, x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec79">1,&nbsp;79</a> (where see note);
ib.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec100">§100</a>. This use of the word
is poetical: Hor. A.&nbsp;P. 320; Car. iv. 13, 17. For <i>venustas</i>,
<i>lepor</i> occurs in Cicero with the same meaning, see de Orat. i.
§243: Or. §96.</p>

<p>Other points in connection with the use of substantives are referred
to
<span class = "pagenum">xlv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexlv" id = "intro_pagexlv"> </a>
in the notes: e.g. the periphrastic construction with <i>vis</i> or
<i>ratio</i> and the gerund (see on <i>vim dicendi</i> x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec1">1,&nbsp;1</a>): the concrete use
of certain nouns in the plural (see on <i>historias</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec75">§75</a>: cp. <i>lectiones</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec45">§45</a>): the concrete use of
abstract nouns (e.g. <i>facilitatem</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec7">3&nbsp;§7</a>: <i>profectus</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec14">5&nbsp;§14</a>: cp. <i>silvarum
amoenitas</i> for <i>silvae amoenae</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec24">3&nbsp;§24</a>). The frequent
occurrence of verbal nouns in <i>-tor</i> must also be noted: in Quint.
they have come to be used almost like adjectives or participles
(<i>hortator</i> x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec23">3,&nbsp;23</a>:
<i>offensator</i> ib.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec20">§20</a>), and may, like
adjectives, be compared by the aid of an adverb (<i>nimium amator</i>

note)<a class = "tag" name = "tag69" id = "tag69" href =

<h5>II. Adjectives.</h5>

<p><b>Beatus</b> (<i>abundans</i>, <i>fecundus</i>): x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec61">1,&nbsp;61</a> <i>beatissima
rerum verborumque copia</i>, where see note: cp. v. 14, 31 <i>beatissimi
amnes</i>. Cicero does not use <i>beatus</i> of things: cp. de Rep. ii.
19, 34 <i>abundantissimus amnis</i>.</p>

<p><b>Densus</b> (like <i>pressus</i> in Cicero):
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec68">§§68</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec73">73</a> (with notes), <i>densus
et brevis et semper instans sibi Thucydides</i>: cp. Cic. de Orat. ii.
§59 <i>Thucydides ita verbis aptus et pressus</i>. So x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec76">1,&nbsp;76</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec106">106</a>.</p>

<p><b>Exactus</b>: x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec14">2,&nbsp;14</a> <i>exactissimo
iudicio</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec30">7&nbsp;§30</a> <i>exacti
commentarii</i>. <i>Exactus</i> bears the same relation to
<i>exigere</i> as <i>perfectus</i> does to <i>perficere</i>, with which
<i>exigere</i> is, in Quintilian, synonymous: <i>e.g.</i> i. 5, 2;
9,&nbsp;2. So Hor. Ep. ii. 1, 72: Suet. Tib. 18: Plin. Ep. 8, 23; also
M.&nbsp;Seneca, and Val. Max. For <i>exactus</i> Cicero used
<i>diligenter elaboratus</i> (Brut. §312) or <i>accuratus</i> (ad Att.
xiii. 45,&nbsp;3): or <i>perfectus</i> (de Orat. i. §§34, 35).</p>

<p><b>Expositus</b> = <i>tritus</i>, <i>communis</i>: x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec11">5,&nbsp;11</a> <i>voluptatem
expositis dare</i>: Iuv. 7, 54 <i>vatem&mdash;qui nihil expositum soleat
deducere, hoc qui communi feriat carmen triviale moneta</i>: Sen. E. 55.
Cicero has (de Orat. i. 31, 137) <i>omnium communia et contrita
praecepta</i>.</p>

<p><b>Incompositus</b>: x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec66">1,&nbsp;66</a> <i>rudis in
plerisque et incompositus</i> (Aeschylus): cp. iv. 5, 10; ix. 4, 32:
Verg. Georg. i. 350 <i>motus incompositos</i>: Hor. Sat. i. 10, 1: Tac.
Dial. 26: Sen. Ep. 40, 4: Liv. xxiii. 27; v. 28.</p>

<p><b>Otiosus</b> = <i>inutilis</i>, <i>inanis</i>. See on x.

otiosum</i>: cp.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec17">2&nbsp;§17</a>. So Tac. Dial.
40: Plin. S. 10, 62. In Cicero we have <i>vacuus</i>, <i>otio
abundans</i>, Brut. §3: N.D. iii. §39.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xlvi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexlvi" id = "intro_pagexlvi"> </a>
<p><b>Praecipuus</b>, used by itself, see on x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec94">1,&nbsp;94</a>.</p>

<p><b>Summus</b>, in sense of <i>extremus</i>: x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec21">1,&nbsp;21</a>, where see note.
The usage is poetical: cp. Plaut. Pers. 33; Asin. 534: Verg. Aen. ii.
324 <i>venit summa dies</i>: Hor. Ep. i. 1, 1: Ovid ex Pont. iv. 9, 59,
Am. iii. 9, 27: Iuv. i.&nbsp;5. Schmalz (<i>Ueber den Sprachgebrauch des
Asinius Pollio&mdash;München</i>, 1890, p.&nbsp;36) contends that this
use is not Ciceronian, for while Pollio writes <i>summo ludorum die</i>
(ad Fam. x. 32,&nbsp;3) and Caelius <i>summis Circensibus ludis</i> (ad
Fam. viii. 12, 3&mdash;<i>Manutius: <b>extremis</b> diebus Circensium
ludorum meorum</i>), Cicero himself says (ad Fam. vii. 1,&nbsp;3)
<i>extremus elephantorum dies fuit</i>.</p>

<p><b>Supinus</b> = <i>ignavus</i> (as <span class = "greek" title =
"huptios">ὕπτιος</span>, p.&nbsp;xliii. above): x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec17">2,&nbsp;17</a> <i>otiosi et
supini</i>: cp. ix. 4, 137 <i>tarda et supina compositio</i>: Iuv. i.
66: Mart. vi. 42 <i>Non attendis et aure supina Iamdudum negligenter
audis</i>. This word may have been used first by Quintilian in this
sense: in Cicero it is used of the body, e.g. de Div. i. 53, 120.</p>

<p>Noticeable also, and characteristic of his time, is Quintilian’s use
of <i>plerique</i> and <i>plurimi</i>, the former having often the force
of <i>nonnulli</i>, <i>plures</i>, <i>multi</i> (x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec26">1&nbsp;§§26</a>,

losing its force as a superlative, and standing generally for
<i>permulti</i> (x.

<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec17">7&nbsp;§17</a>).</p>

<p>Nothing is more common in Quintilian than the use of adjectives (and
participles) in the place of nouns.<a class = "tag" name = "tag70" id =
"tag70" href = "#note70">70</a> In some cases this arises from the
actual omission of a noun, which can readily be supplied to define the
meaning of the adjective: for example x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec20">5,&nbsp;20</a>
<i>decretoriis</i> (sc. <i>armis</i>) <i>exerceatur</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec100">1&nbsp;§100</a> <i>togatis</i>
(sc. <i>fabulis</i>) <i>excellit Afranius</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec88">1&nbsp;§88</a> <i>lascivus
quidem in herois</i> (sc. <i>versibus</i>) <i>quoque Ovidius</i>. But in
most cases there is no perceptible ellipse; the general idea intended is
contained in the adjective itself. In the Masculine and Feminine only
those adjectives can be used as nouns which express personal qualities,
as of character, position, reputation, &amp;c.: the Neuter denotes
generally the properties of things, mostly abstractions. Following the
arrangement of Dr. Hirt’s paper, we may cite examples from the Tenth
Book as follows:&mdash;</p>


<h5 class = "boldf">The Neuter Adjective.</h5>

<p>(1) <i>The Neuter singular used by itself</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Frequent instances occur in prepositional phrases, with accusative
and ablative: these are mostly local, and the great extension of the
usage in post-Augustan times points to the influence of Greek analogy
(<span class = "greek" title = "ex isou, ek tou phanerou k.t.l.">ἐξ
ἴσου, ἐκ τοῦ φανεροῦ κ.τ.λ.</span>). Examples are: <i>in altum</i>

governs like a noun, the genitive depending on it being always
partitive: e.g. <i>multum</i>

<p>(2) <i>The Neuter Plural.</i></p>

<p>Instances need not be cited where adjectives are used substantivally
in cases which can be recognised as neuter: e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec6">3&nbsp;§6</a> <i>scriptorum
proxima</i>. Quintilian gave a wide extension to the usage even where
the case could not be recognised. It can be detected most easily, of
course, when the adjective is used alongside of nouns, e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec8">5&nbsp;§8</a> <i>sua brevitati
gratia</i>, <i>sua copiae</i>, <i>alia translatis virtus</i>, <i>alia
propriis</i>; or when another adjective or pronoun is used in the nom.
or acc., e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec35">1&nbsp;§35</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec32">3&nbsp;§32</a> <i>novorum

<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec123">1&nbsp;§123</a> we have one of
the few instances of the addition of another adjective to an adjective
doing duty for a noun&mdash;<i>paucissimos adhuc eloquentes litterae
Romanae tulerunt</i>.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Masculine Singular.</i></p>

<p>When the adjective can denote a class collectively, it may be used as
a noun: this is quite frequent in Quintilian, as in most writers,
especially when the adjective stands near a substantive, e.g.
<i>perorare in adulterum</i>, <i>aleatorem</i>, <i>petulantem</i> ii.
4,&nbsp;22.</p>

<p>The following are cases of the isolated use of the masculine
singular: (Genitive) x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec26">2,&nbsp;26</a> <i>prudentis
est</i>: (Accusative)
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec3">2&nbsp;§3</a> <i>similem raro

<h5 class = "boldf">The Participle used as a Noun.</h5>

<p>(1) <i>The Neuter Singular.</i></p>

<p>Participles follow the analogy of the adjective. In addition to those
which have actually become nouns (e.g. <i>responsum</i>,
<i>praeceptum</i>, <i>promissum</i>, &amp;c.), Quintilian uses several
participles as nouns in a manner that is again an extension of classical
usage. So even with a pronoun, or another adjective: e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec2">2&nbsp;§2</a> <i>ad propositum
praescriptum</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec11">§11</a> <i>ad alienum
propositum</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec12"><ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘5 §72’">5&nbsp;§12</ins></a> <i>decretum
quoddam atque praeceptum</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec24">7&nbsp;§24</a> <i>promptum hoc
et in expedito positum</i>.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Neuter Plural.</i></p>

<p>Instances of the usual kind are too numerous to mention: the
participle in <i>-us</i>, <i>-a</i>, <i>-um</i> is found frequently in
abl., gen., and dat. Not so common is the plural of the 3rd decl.:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec86">1&nbsp;§86</a> <i>eminentibus
vincimur</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec5">3&nbsp;§5</a> <i>nec protinus
offerentibus se gaudeamus</i>, <i>adhibeatur indicium inventis</i>,
<i>dispositio probatis</i>.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Perfect Participle.</i></p>

<p>In regard to the masculine plural Quintilian here follows the
Ciceronian usage, according to which the participle is employed when a
definite class of individuals is indicated, and a <i>qui</i> clause when
the description is more unrestricted. Instances of the participle are
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec131">1&nbsp;§131</a> <i>robustis et
<span class = "pagenum">xlix</span>
<a name = "intro_pagexlix" id = "intro_pagexlix"> </a>
satis firmatis legendus</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec2">3&nbsp;§2</a> 7 <i>occupatos in
noctem necessitas agit</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec17">5&nbsp;§17</a>
<i>exercitatos</i>; rather more general is <i>a&nbsp;conrogatis
laudantur</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec18">1&nbsp;§18</a>. The Masculine
Singular is, in classical Latin, generally found along with a
substantive, it being incorrect to use any such expression as, for
example, <i>manes occisi placare</i>. Quintilian makes a very free use
of this participle: e.g. i. 2, 24 <i>reddebat victo certaminis
polestatem</i>: v. 12, 2 <i>spiculum in corpore occisi inventum
est</i>,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Future Participle.</i></p>

<p>The use of this participle received a great extension in
post-Augustan times. The following are instances of its employment as a
substantive: i. 4, 17 <i>non doceo, sed admoneo docturos</i>: 21
<i>liberum opinaturis relinquo</i>: and in the singular iv. 1, 52 <i>hoc
adicio ut dicturus intueatur quid, apud quem dicendum sit</i>.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The Present Participle.</i></p>

<p>Frequent as is the substantival use of this participle in all Latin
authors, in none is it more frequent than in Quintilian&mdash;generally
in the Gen. and Dat. Sing. and Plur., not so common in the Nom. and Acc.
Pl., and seldom in the Abl. and Nom. Sing. In some instances it is found
alongside of a noun: e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec2">2&nbsp;§2</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec3">7&nbsp;§3</a>. The most common
example of the Gen. Sing., standing alone, is (as might be expected from
the subject-matter of the <i>Institutio</i>) <i>discentis</i>,
<i>dicentis</i>, &amp;c., e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec6">1&nbsp;§6</a>: for the Dative see
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec17">1&nbsp;§§17</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec24">24</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec30">30</a>: Accusative
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec20">1&nbsp;§20</a>: Ablative
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec15">1&nbsp;§15</a> (<i>intellegere
sine demonstrante</i>): <i>eminentibus</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec86">1&nbsp;§86</a>: cp. <i>illis ...
recipientibus</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec12">5&nbsp;§12</a>. In the plural,
the Genitive and Dative are equally common: for the Nominative may be
quoted
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec15">2&nbsp;§15</a>
<i>imitantes</i>: for the Accusative
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec16">1&nbsp;§16</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec26">2&nbsp;§26</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec25">3&nbsp;§25</a>.</p>


<h5>III. Pronouns.</h5>

<p><b>Ipse</b> follows the usual rules. For an interesting point in
connection with its use, see on
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec15">2&nbsp;§15</a>. It is often
used as = <i>per se</i>, e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec117">1&nbsp;§117</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec21">3&nbsp;§21</a>: often with
pronouns, e.g. <i>vel hoc ipso</i> (<span class = "greek" title = "di’ auto touto">δι᾽ αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span>)
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec75">1&nbsp;§75</a>, cp.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec8">5&nbsp;§8</a>. For <i>et ipse</i>
see note on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec31">1&nbsp;§31</a>.</p>

<p><b>Hic</b> seems frequently to be used with reference to the
circumstances of the writer’s own times: e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec43">1&nbsp;§43</a> <i>recens haec
lascivia</i>: and probably also
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec31">7&nbsp;§31</a> <i>hanc brevem
adnotationem</i>. (This is certainly the case with <i>ille</i>: e.g.
<i>illis dictandi deliciis</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec18">3&nbsp;§18</a>: <i>ille
laudantium clamor</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec17">1&nbsp;§17</a>.) It has been
suggested that in some cases the manuscripts may be wrong: e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec6">1&nbsp;§6</a> <i>ex his</i> (for
<i>ex iis</i>?): but cp.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec25">1&nbsp;§§25</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec33">33</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec40">40</a>, &amp;c. Such instances
of a preference for <i>hic</i> over <i>is</i> come under Priscian’s rule
(xvi. 58), <i><b>Hic</b>
<span class = "pagenum">l</span>
<a name = "intro_pagel" id = "intro_pagel"> </a>
non solum de <b>praesente</b> verum etiam de <b>absente</b> possumus
dicere, ad <b>intellectum</b> referentes demonstrativum</i>.</p>

<p>The conjunction of <i>nullus</i> and <i>non</i>
(=&nbsp;<i>quisque</i>, <i>omnis</i>) is common in Quintilian and
Suetonius:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec25">7&nbsp;§25</a> <i>nullo non
tempore et loco</i>: cp. iii. 6, 7: ix. 4, 83: Suet. Aug. 32; Tib. 66;
Nero 16, &amp;c.: Mart. 8,&nbsp;20.</p>

<p><b>Quicunque</b> has in Quintilian completely acquired the force of
an indefinite pronoun: see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec12">1&nbsp;§12</a>; <a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">105</a>.</p>

<p><b>Quilibet unus</b> (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec1">1&nbsp;§1</a>) does not occur in Cicero:
cp. i. 12, 7: v. 10, 117.</p>

<p><b>Ut qui</b> is frequently found in place of the Ciceronian
<i>quippe qui</i>, <i>utpote qui</i>: see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec55">1&nbsp;§55</a>.</p>


<h5>IV. Verbs.</h5>

<p>An instance of the use of simple for compound verbs (frequent in
Quintilian and the Silver Age generally, and a mark of the ‘poetization’
of Latin prose) occurs
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec99">1&nbsp;§99</a> <i>licet
Caecilium veteres laudibus ferant</i>: see note <i>ad loc.</i>, and cp.
Plin. Ep. viii. 18, 3: Suet. Oth. 12, Vesp.&nbsp;6. In Cicero we have
<i>efferre laudibus</i>, de Am. §24: de Off. ii. §36: de Orat. iii. §52.
So elsewhere in Quintilian <i>finire</i> for <i>definire</i>,
<i>solari</i> for <i>consolari</i>, <i>spargere</i> for
<i>dispergere</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Examples of a change in the meaning of verbs common to Cicero and
Quintilian are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Componere</b> occurs now in the sense of <i>sedare</i>,
<i>placare</i>: e.g. ix. 4, 12 <i>ut, si quid fuisset turbidiorum
cogitationum, componerent</i>: iii. 4, 15 <i>concitando componendisve
adfectibus</i> (Cicero, de Orat. i. §202 <i>motum dicendo vel
<b>excitare</b> vel <b>sedare</b></i>): cp. x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec119">1,&nbsp;119</a> <i>Vibius
Crispus compositus et iucundus</i>, whereas Cicero has (Or. §176)
<i>Isocrates est in ipsis numeris <b>sedatior</b></i>. So Pollio, ad
Fam. x. 33, 3 has the phrase <i>bellum componere</i>: cp. Hor. Ep. ii.
1, 8 <i>componere litem</i>: Verg. Aen. iv. 341 <i>componere
curas</i>&mdash;both at the end of a hexameter: Tac. Hist. iv. 50: Suet.
Caes. 4.</p>

<p><b>Digerere</b> = <i>concoquere</i>: see
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec19">1&nbsp;§19</a>. For
<i>concoquere</i> in Cicero, see de Fin. ii. §64: de N.&nbsp;D. ii.
§§24, 124, 136.</p>

<p><b>Praedicere</b> = <i>antea</i>, <i>supra dicere</i>: see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec74">1&nbsp;§74</a>.</p>

<p><b>Recipere</b> = <i>probare</i> (<span class = "greek" title =
"apodechomai">ἀποδέχομαι</span>):
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec31">7&nbsp;§31</a>, and often.</p>

<p><b>Vacat</b>: used impersonally
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec58">1&nbsp;§§58</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec90">90</a>: cp. i. 12, 12. This
usage is not found in Cicero.</p>


<h5>V. Adverbs.</h5>

<p><b>Abunde</b> is often found along with adjectives and adverbs, to
increase their force:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec25">1&nbsp;§25</a> <i>abunde
similes</i> (where see note):
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec104">§104</a> <i>elatum abunde
spiritum</i>. It has something of the emphasis of Cicero’s <i>satis
superque</i>.</p>

<p><b>Adhuc</b> occurs very frequently with a comparative: see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec71">1&nbsp;§71</a> (<i>plus
adhuc</i>) and
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec99">§99</a>. It is often used also
(as in Livy and others) of
<span class = "pagenum">li</span>
<a name = "intro_pageli" id = "intro_pageli"> </a>
past time, when it = <i>eo etiam tempore</i>, or <i>etiam tum</i>: e.g.
<i>scholae adhuc operatum</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec13">3&nbsp;§13</a>: cp. i. 8, 2:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec27">2&nbsp;§27</a>.</p>

<p><b>Alioqui</b> has different uses in Quintilian, as in Tacitus. (1)
It occurs pretty much as <span class = "greek" title = "ta men alla">τὰ
μὲν ἄλλα</span> in Greek, with very little of an antithesis: e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec64">1&nbsp;§64</a> <i>Simonides,
tenuis alioqui, sermone proprio et iucunditate commendari potest</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec32">3&nbsp;§32</a> <i>expertus
iuvenem, studiosum alioqui, praelongos habuisse sermones</i>, &amp;c.
(There is a definite antithesis in what seems to be the corresponding
usage in Tacitus, when <i>alioqui</i> is opposed to an adverb of time:
e.g, Ann. iii. 8 <i>cum incallidus alioqui et facilis iuventa senilibus
</i>tum<i> artibus uteretur</i>: xiii. 20 <i>ingreditur Paris, solitus
alioquin id temporis luxus principis intendere, sed </i>tunc<i>
compositus ad maestitiam.</i>) (2) It is equivalent to <i>praeterea</i>,
‘besides’:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec13">3&nbsp;§13</a> <i>in
eloquentia Galliarum ... princeps, alioqui inter paucos disertus</i>.
Cp. Tac. Ann. iv. 11 <i>ordo alioqui sceleris ... patefactus est</i>.
This sense is an easy transition from ‘for the rest.’ The instance in
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec128">1&nbsp;§128</a> (<i>cuius et
multae alioqui et magnae virtutes fuerunt</i>) seems to fall also under
this head, unless it means ‘apart from’ the doubtful compliments they
paid him (Seneca) by imitating him: cp. Tac. Ann. iv. 37 <i>validus
alioqui spernendis honoribus</i>. (3) <i>Alioqui</i> stands for
‘otherwise,’ ‘in the opposite case,’ either with a <i>si</i> clause, as
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec16">3&nbsp;§16</a> <i>immutescamus
alioqui si nihil dicendum videatur</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec30">§30</a> <i>quid alioqui fiet
... si particulas</i>, &amp;c.: or without,
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVI_sec6">6&nbsp;§6</a> <i>alioqui vel
extemporalem temeritatem malo quam male cohaerentem cogitationem</i>.
Cp. Tac. Ann. ii. 38: xi. 6.</p>

<p><b>Certe</b> stands for <i>quidem</i> when the point of the sentence
is reinforced by an illustration:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVI_sec4">6&nbsp;§4</a> <i>Cicero certe
... tradidit</i>: cp. xii. 1, 43: vi. 2,&nbsp;3.</p>

<p><i>Demum</i>, which in classical Latin is an adverb of time
(‘lastly’), stands in Quintilian, and other writers of the Silver Age,
for <i>tantum</i>, <i>dumtaxat</i>, the idea of time having disappeared:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec44">1&nbsp;§44</a> <i>pressa demum
et tenuia</i>, where see note: cp.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec13">3&nbsp;§13</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVI_sec5">6&nbsp;§5</a>. With pronouns it
is frequently used, for emphasis, like <i>adeo</i>: e.g. Cic. de Orat.
ii. §131 <i>sed hi loci ei demum oratori prodesse possunt, qui est
versatus in rebus vel usu</i>.</p>

<p><b>Interim</b> often stands for <i>interdum</i>, as
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec9">1&nbsp;§9</a>, where see note. At
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec33">3&nbsp;§33</a> we have
<i>interim ... interim</i> for <i>modo ... modo</i>, as also i. 7, 11:
<i>interim ... interdum</i> vi. 2, 12: <i>interim ... non numquam ...
saepe</i> iv. 5, 20: <i>semper ... interim</i> ii. 1,&nbsp;1.</p>

<p><b>Longe</b> and <b>multum</b> are both used with comparatives,
instead of <i>multo</i>: e.g. <i>longe clarius</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec67">1&nbsp;§67</a> (where see note):
<i>multum tersior</i> (<span class = "greek" title = "polu">πολύ</span>)
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec94">1&nbsp;§94</a> (note).</p>

<p><b>Mox</b> is used in enumerations in place of <i>deinde</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVI_sec3">6&nbsp;§3</a>
<i>primum&mdash;tum&mdash;mox</i>: cp. i. 2, 29 <i>primum&mdash;mox</i>:
ib. 9, 2 <i>primum&mdash;mox&mdash;tum</i>.</p>

<p><b>Nec</b> = <i>ne quidem</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec7">3&nbsp;§7</a> <i>alioqui nec
scriberentur</i>. Cp. ix. 2, 67 <i>quod in foro non expedit, illic nec

<span class = "pagenum">lii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelii" id = "intro_pagelii"> </a>
<p><b>Non</b> occurs with the 1st pers. plur. (<a href =
"QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec16">3&nbsp;§16</a>, cp.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec5">3&nbsp;§5</a>) and 3rd pers.
sing.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec27">2&nbsp;§27</a> where see note,
(also after <i>dum</i> xii. 10, 48 and <i>modo</i> iii. 11, 24) where
Cicero would have had <i>ne</i>: cp. i. 1, 19 <i>non ergo perdamus</i>:
ib. §5 <i>non adsuescat ergo</i>. Cp. <i>utinam non</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec100">§100</a>: and see note on
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec27">2&nbsp;§27</a>.</p>

<p><b>Non nisi</b>. These particles (<i>non</i>, <i>nisi</i>) are used
together with the force of an adverb,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec24">1&nbsp;§24</a> (where see note):
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec29">3&nbsp;§29</a>. Cp. Ov. Tr.
iii. 12, 36.</p>

<p><b>Olim</b> is never used by Cicero of future time, as
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec94">1&nbsp;§94</a> and
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec104">104</a> (where see note). Cp.
Plin. Panegyr. 15.</p>

<p><b>Plane</b>, though common enough in classical Latin, as in
Quintilian, with verbs and adjectives, is not found so often in
conjunction with other adverbs. There may be a touch of colloquialism
about such a phrase as <i>ut plane manifesto appareat</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec53">1&nbsp;§53</a>: cp. Pollio, in
Cic. ad Fam. x. 32, 1 <i>plane bene</i>: ad Att. xiii. 6, 2: <i>plane
belle</i> ib. xii. 37,&nbsp;1.</p>

<p><b>Protinus</b> has its usual meaning (<i>statim</i>) in
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec5">3&nbsp;§5</a> (where it is best
taken with <i>gaudeamus</i>, not with <i>offerentibus</i>): cp.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec21">7&nbsp;§21</a>. Its employment
to denote logical consequence is noted at
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec3">1&nbsp;§3</a>: cp. <i>ib.</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec42">§42</a>.</p>

<p><b>Saltem</b> is often used for <i>quidem</i> and <i>neque saltem</i>
for <i>ne quidem</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec15">2&nbsp;§15</a> <i>nec vero
saltem iis</i>, &amp;c., where see note: cp. i. 1, 24 <i>neque enim mihi
illud saltem placet</i>.</p>

<p><b>Sicut (ut) ... ita</b>. This formula is especially common in
Quintilian, either with or without a negative: see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec1">1&nbsp;§1</a>, and cp. 
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec3">§§3</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec14">14</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec72">72</a>: ix. 2, 88, &amp;c.</p>

<p><b>Ubicumque</b>, like <i>quicumque</i>, has become an indefinite:
e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec28">7&nbsp;§28</a> <i>quidquid
loquemur ubicumque</i>. The more classical use is found at
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec5">1&nbsp;§§5</a> and
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec10">10</a>.</p>

<p><b>Utique</b>: see note on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec20">1&nbsp;§20</a>.</p>

<p><b>Utrimque</b> is used not of place, but of the ‘opposite sides’ of
a question:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec20">5&nbsp;§20</a> <i>causas
utrimque tractet</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec131">1&nbsp;§131</a>: cp. v. 10, 81:
Hor. Ep. i. 18, 9: Tac. Hist. i. 14.</p>

<p><b>Velut</b> occurs more commonly than either <i>quasi</i> or
<i>tamquam</i> in comparisons: see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec5">1&nbsp;§5</a> <i>velut opes
quaedam</i>, and cp.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec18">§§18</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec61">61</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec3">3&nbsp;§3</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec17">5&nbsp;§17</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec1">7&nbsp;§1</a>. So also
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec6">7&nbsp;§6</a> <i>ducetur ante
omnia rerum ipsa serie velut duce</i>.</p>


<h5>VI. Prepositions.</h5>

<p><b>Ab</b> for ‘on leaving,’ as in the poets and Livy:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec17">5&nbsp;§17</a> <i>ne ab illa, in
qua consenuerunt, umbra discrimina velut quendam solem reformident</i>:
cp. xi. 3, 22: i. 6, 25: Ov. Met. iv. 329: Plin. N.&nbsp;H. xiv.
7,&nbsp;9. So <span class = "greek" title = "apo">ἀπὸ</span> in Homer,
Il. viii. 53 <span class = "greek" title = "Hoi d’ ara deipnon helonto karêkomoôntes Achaioi Rhimpha kata klisias, apo d’ autou thôrêssonto">Οἱ
δ᾽ ἄρα δεῖπνον ἕλοντο καρηκομόωντες Ἀχαιοὶ Ῥίμφα κατὰ κλισίας, ἀπὸ δ᾽
αὐτοῦ θωρήσσοντο</span>.</p>

<p><b>Circa</b> does duty in Quintilian for <i>in</i>, <i>de</i>,
<i>ad</i>, <i>erga</i>, &amp;c.: cp. the use of <span class = "greek"
title = "peri">περί</span>, <span class = "greek" title =
"amphi">ἀμφί</span> with the acc. in Greek<ins class = "correction"
title = "period missing">. </ins>So
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec52">1&nbsp;§52</a> <i>utiles circa
praecepta sententiae</i>: see note <i>ad loc</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">liii</span>
<a name = "intro_pageliii" id = "intro_pageliii"> </a>
<p><b>Citra</b> very often stands for <i>sine</i> or <i>praeter</i>:
e.g. <i>citra lectionis exemplum</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec2">1&nbsp;§2</a>, where see note:
cp. i. 4, 4 <i>neque citra musicen grammatice potest esse perfecta</i>.
In Cicero <i>citra</i> is used only of place.</p>

<p>The following prepositional expressions should also be
noted:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Ante omnia</b> = <i>primum</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec3">1&nbsp;§3</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec4">2&nbsp;§4</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec6">7&nbsp;§6</a>. In
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec3">1&nbsp;§3</a> we have <i>ante
omnia</i>, <i>proximum</i>, <i>novissimum</i>: cp. iv. 2, 52 <i>ante
omnia</i>, <i>deinde</i>: iii. 9, 6 <i>ante omnia</i>, <i>deinde</i>,
<i>tum</i>, <i>postremo</i>.</p>

<p><b>Cum eo quod</b> is used as a transition formula for the Ciceronian
<i>accedit quod</i>. A&nbsp;certain case of this usage occurs xii. 10,
47: the instance at x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec13">7,&nbsp;13</a> has been
challenged, but see the note.</p>

<p><b>Ex integro</b>. Quintilian prefers the use of <i>ex</i> in such
phrases to <i>de</i>: e.g. x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec20">1&nbsp;§20</a> (where see note):
<i>ex industria</i> ib.: and so <i>ex abundanti</i>, <i>ex professo</i>,
<i>ex pari</i>, &amp;c., elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Inter paucos</b>, ‘as few have ever been’:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec13">3&nbsp;§13</a> <i>inter paucos
disertus</i>.</p>

<p><b>Per quae</b> (<i>quod</i>) of agency or instrument:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec87">1&nbsp;§87</a> <i>in iis per
quae nomen est adsecutus</i>.</p>

<p><b>Propter quae</b> (<i>quod</i>) for <i>quam ob rem</i>, especially
in transitions: see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec10">1&nbsp;§10</a>.</p>

<p><b>Praeter id quod</b> for <i>praeterquam quod</i>: see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec28">1&nbsp;§28</a>.</p>

<p><b>Sine dubio</b>. The use of this phrase at
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec51">1&nbsp;§51</a> may possibly be
an instance of the peculiarity noted by Spalding on i. 6, 12, where he
points out that Quintilian frequently makes it stand for <i>quidem</i>,
in clauses where the idea is by <i>sine dubio</i> made of less account
than some other statement immediately following, and introduced by
<i>tamen</i> or <i>sed</i> (as i. 6, 12 and 14). Examples are v. 7, 28
<i>sine dubio ... tamen</i>: v. 10, 53 and viii. 3, 67 <i>sine dubio ...
sed</i>. Applying this to x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec51">1,&nbsp;51</a> <i>Verum hic
omnes sine dubio et in omni genere eloquentiae procul a se reliquit,
epicos tamen praecipue</i>, we might bring out the construction by
rendering, ‘But while of course (or ‘to be sure’) Homer has
out-distanced all rivals, in every kind of eloquence, it is the epic
poets whom he leaves furthest behind.’ Cp. on
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec15">3&nbsp;§15</a>.</p>


<h5>VII. Conjunctions.</h5>

<p>Under this head may come <b>Adde quod</b>, a phrase which occurs
seven times in Quintilian, five times in the Tenth Book:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec3">1&nbsp;§§3</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec16">16</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec10">2&nbsp;§§10</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec11">11</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec12">12</a>: xii. 1, 4 and 11, 29.
Schmalz (<i>Ueber den Sprachgebrauch des Asinius Pollio</i>) remarks
that it must be ranked rather with Pollio ad Fam. x. 31, 4 (<i>adde huc
quod</i>), where <i>quod</i> is to be taken as a conjunction, than with
Cic. ad Att. vi. 1, 7, ad Fam. xiii. 41, 1 (<i>addo etiam illud
quod</i>), and ad Fam. xvi. 16, 1 (<i>adde hoc quod</i>), where
<i>quod</i> is a relative referring to the foregoing demonstrative. The
phrase is originally
<span class = "pagenum">liv</span>
<a name = "intro_pageliv" id = "intro_pageliv"> </a>
poetical: it is found in Attius, frequently in Lucretius (i. 847: iii.
827: iv. 1113), in the <i>Satires</i> and <i>Epistles</i> of Horace, and
over and over again in Ovid: Vergil seems to avoid it. Pollio probably
introduced it into prose, and from him it passed to others: Schmalz
refers to Plin. Ep. viii. 14, 3: iii. 14, 6: Sen. 40, 4: Symmach. 2, 7:
4, 71: Fronto, p.&nbsp;92&nbsp;N.</p>

<p><b>Cum interim</b> = ‘though all the time.’ See note on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec18">1&nbsp;§18</a>: cp. § III.</p>

<p><b>Dum ... non</b> stands for <i>dummodo ... non</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec7">3&nbsp;§7</a>: cp. xii. 10, 48.
The usage is poetical. <i>Dummodo</i> does not occur in Quintilian.</p>

<p><b>Enim</b> occurs, conformably to classical usage, in the third
place after a word preceded by a preposition: e.g. <i>ad profectum
enim</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec15">3&nbsp;§15</a>: and so
frequently after <i>sum</i>,&mdash;<a href =
"QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec10">2&nbsp;§10</a> <i>necesse est enim</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec14">1&nbsp;§14</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec15">7&nbsp;§§15</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec24">24</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec19">2&nbsp;§19</a>. But <i>nihil
enim est</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec78">1&nbsp;§78</a>, where Krüger
suggests <i>nihil enim inest</i>.</p>

<p><b>Etsi</b>. As it is generally stated that <i>etsi</i> does not
occur in Quintilian it may be well to include it here. Instances are i.
pr. 19: i. 5, 28: v. 13, 3: ix. i, 19.</p>

<p><b>Ideoque</b> is constantly used for <i>itaque</i>. See note on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec21">1&nbsp;§21</a>.</p>

<p><b>Licet</b> = <i>etsi</i>, as sometimes in Cicero:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec99">1&nbsp;§99</a>: ii. 2, 8 and
passim.</p>

<p><b>Quamlibet</b> and <b>quamquam</b>. Quintilian uses these words (in
clauses which contain no verb) along with adjectives, participles, and
adverbs:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec19">3&nbsp;§19</a> <i>nam in stilo
quidem quamlibet properato</i>: cp. viii. 6, 4 <i>oratione quamlibet
clara</i>: xii. 8, 7 <i>quamlibet verbose</i>: xi. 1, 34 <i>quamquam
plena sanguinis</i>. A&nbsp;similar use of <i>quamvis</i> is less
uncommon in other writers: cp.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec74">1&nbsp;§74</a> <i>quamvis
bonorum</i>: ib. §94 <i>quamvis uno libra</i> (where see note). See
Madvig on Cic. de Fin. v. §68.</p>

<p><b>Quia</b> is sometimes used where <i>quod</i> (<i>eo quod</i>)
might have been expected:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec15">1&nbsp;§15</a> <i>hoc sunt
exempla potentiora ... quia</i>: cp.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec14">5&nbsp;§14</a> <i>Declamationes
vero ... sunt utilissimae quia</i> (Halm) <i>inventionem et
dispositionem pariter exercent</i>. So i. 6, 39 <i>nam et auctoritatem
antiquitatis habent</i> (sc. <i>verba a vetustate repetita</i>) <i>et,
quia intermissa sunt, gratiam novitati similem parant</i>. Cp. <i>non
quia non</i> (with the subjunctive) x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec19">7,&nbsp;19</a> and
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec31">31</a>: so ii. 2, 2: iv. 1, 5,
65: viii. 3, 42: ix. 1, 23; 4,&nbsp;20.</p>

<p><b>Quoque</b> often occurs alongside of an adjective, to increase its
force, where older writers would have had <i>vel</i> or <i>etiam</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec20">1&nbsp;§20</a> <i>ex industria
quoque</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec14">2&nbsp;§14</a> <i>in magnis
quoque auctoribus</i>: cp.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec121">1&nbsp;§121</a> <i>ceterum
interceptus quoque magnum sibi vindicat locum</i>: ii. II, I <i>exemplo
magni quoque nominis professorum</i>.</p>

<p><b>Quotiens</b> = <i>cum</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIV_sec3">4&nbsp;§3</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec29">7&nbsp;§29</a>. Cp. iv. 1, 76:
viii. 3,&nbsp;55.</p>


<p class = "space">
For the rest, Quintilian’s style cannot be called artistic. It is indeed
generally clear and simple: instances of obscurity are very often
traceable to the ‘insanabilis error’ in the old text, of which Leonardo
wrote
<span class = "pagenum">lv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelv" id = "intro_pagelv"> </a>
to Poggio, and which the progress of criticism has done so much to
remedy. It is also free from all bombast and excessive embellishment.
But there is little of the graceful and ample movement of the Ciceronian
period: the sentence often halts, as it were, there are frequent
instances of harsh expression, and the periods are awkwardly
constructed. Quintilian was not an artist in style. Probably the
technicalities of his subject kept him from thinking too much of such
matters as rhythm, cadence, and harmony. His main object was to say
clearly and directly what he wanted to say, without laying too great
stress on the form in which it was cast. The leading thought is
generally stated at once, and everything subordinate to it is left to
take care of itself. Hence it is that causal clauses are allowed to come
dragging in at the end of a sentence (x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec13">2&nbsp;§§13</a> and
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec23">23</a>), and adjectival or
attributive clauses stand by themselves in a position of remarkable
isolation (<i>vel ob hoc memoria dignum</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec80">1&nbsp;§80</a>: <i>rebus tamen
acuti magis quam</i>, &amp;c.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec84">1&nbsp;§84</a>: cp. §§85, 95,
103). Relative sentences also are introduced in a detached sort of
fashion (<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec80">1&nbsp;§80</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec28">2&nbsp;§28</a>). The thought is
sometimes hard to follow (as notably in the opening sections of the
Tenth Book: cp.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec13">2&nbsp;§§13</a> and
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec20">§§20</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec21">21</a>;
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec7">7&nbsp;§7</a>), because the
composition is not framed as a harmonious whole: the transition
particles are loosely used (see on <i>nam</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec12">1&nbsp;§12</a>: cp. §50,
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec31">7&nbsp;§31</a>: <i>quidem</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec88">1&nbsp;§88</a>), and are
sometimes wanting altogether, especially in the case of figures suddenly
and abruptly introduced (see on
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec4">1&nbsp;§4</a>: cp.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec1">7&nbsp;§1</a>). Instances of a
more or less artificial striving after variety of expression are often
met with: e.g.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec36">1&nbsp;§§36</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec41">41</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec83">83</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec102">102</a>. In the order of words
there is sometimes the same departure from customary usage (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec109">1&nbsp;§109</a>,
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec17">2&nbsp;§17</a>), especially in
the case of proper names (<a href =
"QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec86">1&nbsp;§86</a> <i>Afro Domitio</i> for
<i>Domitio Afro</i>: cp. <i>Atacinus Varro</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec87">§87</a>: <i>Bassus Aufidius</i>

occur:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec65">1&nbsp;§65</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec105">§105</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec25">7&nbsp;§25</a>. Under this
head may be included the omission of the subject:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec7">1&nbsp;§7</a> <i>congregat</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec66">§66</a> <i>permiserunt</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec4">7&nbsp;§4</a> <i>malit ...

<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec56">1&nbsp;§56</a>
<i>congerentes</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec7">1&nbsp;§7</a> <i>solitos</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec107">1&nbsp;§107</a> <i>quibus nihil

<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec24">2&nbsp;§24</a>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec25">3&nbsp;§25</a>. In the same
way <i>esse</i> is frequently omitted for the sake of brevity:

The frequent occurrence of figures taken from the gladiatorial arena or
the field of battle may be made the subject of a concluding paragraph<a
class = "tag" name = "tag72" id = "tag72" href = "#note72">72</a>. It is
in keeping with the martial character of the Romans that there is no
more fertile source of metaphor in their literature than the art of war,
which was indeed their favourite pursuit; just as the Greeks drew their
images from nothing more readily than from the sea and those maritime
occupations in which they were so much at home. It is generally to what
is most familiar both to himself and to those whom he is addressing that
a speaker or writer has recourse in order to enforce his meaning. Both
Cicero and Quintilian had lived through troublous times, and it is
little wonder that even in the quiet repose of their rhetorical
treatises we should frequently meet with phrases and illustrations in
which we seem to hear the noise of battle. And under the Flavian
emperors the less serious combats in the Coliseum had come to be looked
upon as great national

entertainments. Hence it was natural to picture the orator, whose main
object is to win persuasion, as one striving for the mastery with
weapons appropriate to the warfare he is waging. No greater compliment
can be found to pay to Julius Caesar than to say that ‘he spoke as he
fought’: <i>tanta in eo vis est, id acumen, ea concitatio, ut illum
eodem animo dixisse quo bellavit appareat</i>, x.
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec114">1,&nbsp;114</a>. The orator
must always be on the alert,&mdash;ever ‘ready for battle,’ <i>in
procinctu</i>
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec2">1&nbsp;§2</a> (where see note):
if he cannot take prompt action, he might as well remain in
camp,&mdash;<i>nullum erit, si tam tardum fuerit, auxilium</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIV_sec4">4&nbsp;§4</a>. His style must be
appropriate to the matter in hand: <i>id quoque vitandum ne in oratione
poetas nobis et historicos ... imitandos putemus. Sua cuique proposito
lex, suus cuique decor est</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec21">2&nbsp;§§21-2</a>. Victory must
ever be the end in view,&mdash;victory in what is a real combat, not a
sham fight:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec29">1&nbsp;§§29-30</a> <i>nos vero

the wiry vigour of an experienced campaigner, and his weapons ought not
to be made for show:

Manuscripts.</h5>

<p class = "mynote">
In this final section of the Introduction, links have been omitted
because they would have been more distracting than useful.
</p>

<p>Considerable interest attaches to the study of the manuscripts of
Quintilian, the oldest of which may be grouped in three main divisions:
(1)&nbsp;the complete manuscripts, (2)&nbsp;the incomplete, and
(3)&nbsp;the mixed.</p>

<p>The most important representative of the first class is the <i>Codex
Ambrosianus</i>, a manuscript of the 10th or 11th century, now at Milan.
As we have it now, it is unfortunately in a mutilated condition, nearly
a fourth part of the folios having been lost (from ix. 4, 135
<i>argumenta acria et cit</i>. to xii. 11, 22 <i>antiquitas ut
possit</i>). Halm secured a new and trustworthy collation of this MS.,
distinguishing carefully between the original text and the readings of
the second hand.</p>

<p>Although now in the defective condition above indicated, the
<i>Ambrosianus</i> must have been originally complete. In this it
differs from the representatives of the second family of MSS., the most
valuable member of which&mdash;the <i>Bernensis</i>&mdash;is of even
greater importance for the constitution of the text than the
<i>Ambrosianus</i>, at least in those parts which it contains. It is the
oldest of all the known manuscripts of Quintilian, belonging to the 10th
century. The peculiarity which it shares with the other members of its
family is that it contains certain great <i>lacunae</i>, which must have
existed also in the manuscript from which it was copied, as they are
indicated in the <i>Bernensis</i> by blank spaces. The size of the first
<i>lacuna</i> varies with the fortunes of the particular codex: in the
<i>Bernensis</i> it extends from the beginning to 2&nbsp;§5 (<i>licet,
et nihilo minus</i>). The others are identical in all cases: v. 14,
12&mdash;viii. 3, 64: viii. 6, 17&mdash;viii. 6, 67: ix. 3, 2&mdash;x.
1,&nbsp;107 (<i>nulla contentio</i>): xi. 1, 71&mdash;xi. 2, 33: and
xii. 10, 43 to the end.</p>

<p>To the same family as the <i>Bernensis</i> belongs the
<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;A, which was directly copied from the
<i>Bernensis</i> not long after the latter had been written: it also is
of the 10th century. But inasmuch as in the <i>Bambergensis</i> the
great <i>lacunae</i> were, at a very early date, filled in by another
hand (<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G<a class = "tag" name = "tag73" id =
"tag73" href = "#note73">73</a>), this manuscript may now rank in the
third group, where it became the parent, as I hope to show below, of the
<span class = "pagenum">lix</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelix" id = "intro_pagelix"> </a>
<i>Harleianus</i> (2664), and through the <i>Harleianus</i> of the
<i>Florentinus</i>, <i>Turicensis</i>, and an innumerable company of
others. Besides reproducing <i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G, these MSS.
follow for the most part the readings introduced by a later hand (called
by Halm <b>b</b>) into the original <i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;A.
A&nbsp;recent examination of the <i>Bambergensis</i> has suggested a
doubt whether the readings known as <b>b</b>, which are often of a very
faulty character, can have been derived from the same codex
as&nbsp;G.</p>

<p>Halm’s critical edition of Quintilian is founded, in the main, on the
manuscripts above mentioned, with a few examples of the 15th century for
the parts where he had only the <i>Ambrosianus</i> and the
<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G, or the latter exclusively, to rely on. Since
the date of the publication of his text (1868) great progress has been
made with the critical study of Quintilian. In 1875 MM.&nbsp;Chatelain
and le&nbsp;Coultre published a collation of the <i>Nostradamensis</i>
(see below), the main results of which have been incorporated in
Meister’s edition (1886-87). And in a critical edition of the First Book
of the <i>Institutio</i> (1890) M.&nbsp;Ch. Fierville has given a most
complete account of all the continental manuscripts, drawing for the
purpose on a previous work in which he had already shown proof of his
interest in the subject (<i>De Quintilianeis Codicibus</i>, 1874).</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Halm’s critical instinct guided him
aright in attaching supreme importance to the <i>Bernensis</i> (with
<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;A), the <i>Ambrosianus</i>, and
<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G. But much has been derived from some
manuscripts of which he took no account, and there is one in particular,
which has hitherto been strangely overlooked, and to which prominence is
accordingly given in this edition. Before proceeding to deal with it,
I&nbsp;shall annex here a brief notice of the various MSS. which figure
in the Critical Notes, grouped in one or other of the three divisions
given above. An editor of the Tenth Book of the <i>Institutio</i> is
especially bound to travel outside the rather narrow range of Halm’s
critical edition, as so much of the existing text (down to 1&nbsp;§107)
has been based mainly on <i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G alone. In addition
to collating, for the purposes of this edition, such MSS. as the
<i>Ioannensis</i> at Cambridge, the <i>Bodleianus</i> and
<i>Balliolensis</i> at Oxford, and the very important Harleian codex,
referred to above, I&nbsp;have also carefully compared eight 15th
century manuscripts in the hope (which the Critical Appendix will show
to have been not entirely disappointed) of gleaning something new. This
part of the present work may be regarded as supplementing, for this
country, what M.&nbsp;Ch. Fierville has already so laboriously
accomplished for the manuscripts of the Continent.</p>

<p>Of the first family, the outstanding example is the
<i>Ambrosianus</i>. The resemblances between it and
<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G are sufficient to show that
<span class = "pagenum">lx</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelx" id = "intro_pagelx"> </a>
the manuscript from which the latter was copied probably belonged to the
same class. But this manuscript, which must have been complete (like the
<i>Ambrosianus</i> originally), has altogether disappeared: one of the
great objects for extending the study of the MSS. of Quintilian beyond
the limits observed by Halm is the hope of being able to distinguish
between such examples as may seem (like the <i>Dorvilianus</i> at
Oxford) to preserve some of the traditions of the family, and those
whose origin may be clearly traced back to <i>Bambergensis</i> A
and&nbsp;G. For all the complete MSS. of Quintilian in existence must be
derived either from this family or from the mixed group of which the
<i>Bambergensis</i>, in its present form, seems to be the undoubted
original.</p>

<p>In the second group we must include, not much inferior to the
<i>Bernensis</i>, the <i>Parisinus Nostradamensis</i> (N) Bibl. Nat.
fonds latin 18527. It is an independent transcript in all probability of
the incomplete MS. from which the <i>Bernensis</i> was copied, and as
such has a distinct value of its own. It is ascribed to the 10th
century. For the readings of this codex I have been able to compare a
collation made by M.&nbsp;Fierville in 1872, with that published by
MM.&nbsp;Chatelain and le Coultre in 1875.</p>

<p>Then there is the <i>Codex Ioannensis</i> (in the library of
St.&nbsp;John’s College, Cambridge), a recent examination of which has
shown me that the account given of it by Spalding (vol. ii. pr.
p.&nbsp;4) must be amended in some particulars. In its present condition
it begins with <i>constaret</i> (i. 2,&nbsp;3), but a portion of the
first page has been cut away for the sake of the ornamental letter:
originally the MS. must have begun at the beginning of the second
chapter, like the <i>Nostradamensis</i>, the <i>Vossiani</i> 1
and&nbsp;2, the <i>Codex Puteanus</i>, and <i>Parisinus</i> 7721 (see
Fierville, p.&nbsp;165). Again, the reading at xi. 2, 33 is clearly
<i>multiplici</i>, not <i>ut duplici</i>, and in this it agrees with the
Montpellier MS. (<i>Pithoeanus</i>), which is known to be a copy (11th
century) of the <i>Bernensis</i> (see M.&nbsp;Bonnet in Revue de Phil.
1887). A&nbsp;remarkable feature about this MS. is the number of
inversions which the writer sets himself to make in the text. These I
have not included in the Critical Notes, but some of them may be
subjoined here, as they may help to establish the derivation of this
manuscript. The codex from which it was copied must have been illegible
in parts: this is probably the explanation of such omissions (the space
being left blank) as <i>tum in ipsis</i> in x. 2,&nbsp;14, and
<i>virtutis</i> ib. §15. It is written in a very small and neat hand,
with no contemporary indication of the great <i>lacunae</i>, and may be
ascribed to the 13th century. It agrees generally with the
<i>Bernensis</i>, though there are striking resemblances also to the
<i>Pratensis</i> (see p.&nbsp;lxiii and note). Among the inversions
referred to are the following:&mdash;x. 3,&nbsp;1 <i>sic etiam
utilitatis</i>, for <i>sic utilitatis etiam</i>: ib. §30 <i>oratione
continua</i>, for <i>continua oratione</i>: 5&nbsp;§8 <i>alia propriis
alia translatis virtus</i>, for <i>alia
<span class = "pagenum">lxi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxi" id = "intro_pagelxi"> </a>
translatis virtus alia propriis</i>: 7&nbsp;§21 <i>stultis eruditi</i>,
for <i>stulti eruditis</i>: ib. §28 <i>solum summum</i>, for <i>summum
solum</i>. Some of these peculiarities (e.g. the inversion at 5&nbsp;§8)
it shares with the Leyden MSS.&mdash;the <i>Vossiani</i> i. and iii., a
collation of which is given in Burmann’s edition: these codices
M.&nbsp;Fierville assigns to that division of his first group in which
the <i>Nostradamensis</i> heads the list (see below, p.&nbsp;lxiv).
I&nbsp;may note also the readings <i>viderit bona et invenit</i> (
2&nbsp;§20), which <i>Ioan.</i> shares with <i>Voss.</i> iii.: <i>potius
libertas ista</i> ( 3&nbsp;§24) <i>Ioan.</i> and <i>Voss.</i> i.;
<i>ubertate</i>&mdash;for <i>libertate</i>&mdash;( 5&nbsp;§15) <i>Ioan.
Voss.</i> i. and iii.</p>

<p>To the same family belongs the <i>Codex Salmantinus</i>, a 12th or
13th century manuscript in the library of the University of Salamanca.
M.&nbsp;Fierville, who kindly placed at my disposal his collation of the
Tenth Book, thinks it must have been indirectly derived from the
<i>Bernensis</i>. He notes some hundred variants in which it differs
from the <i>Nostradamensis</i> (most of them being the errors of a
copyist), and some thirty-seven places in which, while differing from
the <i>Nostradamensis</i>, it agrees with the <i>Bernensis</i> and the
<i>Bambergensis</i>. This MS. also gives <i>ubertate</i> in 5&nbsp;§15 :
it agrees in showing the important reading <i>alte refossa</i> in
3&nbsp;§2 : and resembles the <i>Ioannensis</i> in certain minor
omissions, e.g. <i>certa</i> before <i>necessitate</i> in 5&nbsp;§15 :
<i>idem</i> before <i>laborandum</i> in 7&nbsp;§4 : <i>et</i> before
<i>consuetudo</i> in 7&nbsp;§8 : cp. <i>subiunctura sunt</i> for
<i>subiuncturus est</i> 7&nbsp;§9 . For other coincidences see the
Critical Appendix.</p>

<p>In the same group must be included two MSS. of first-class importance
for the text of Quintilian, for a collation of which (as of the <i>Codex
Salmantinus</i>) I&nbsp;am indebted to the kindness of
M.&nbsp;Fierville. They are the <i>Codex Pralensis</i> (No. 14146 fonds
latin de la Bibliothèque nationale), of the 12th century, and the
<i>Codex Puteanus</i> (No. 7719) of the 13th. The former is the work of
Étienne de Rouen, a monk of the Abbey of Bec, and it consists of
extracts from the <i>Institutio</i> amounting to nearly a third of the
whole. There are eighty sections, of which §76 (<i>de figuris
verborum</i>) includes x. 1&nbsp;§§108-131; §77 (<i>de imitatione</i>)
consists of x. 2,&nbsp;1-28; §78 (<i>quomodo dictandum sit</i>) of x.
3,&nbsp;1-32; and §79 (<i>de laude scriptorum tam Graecorum quam
Latinorum</i>) of x. 1,&nbsp;46-107. The importance of this codex arises
from the fact that it is an undoubted transcript of the
<i>Beccensis</i>, now lost. The <i>Beccensis</i> is supposed by
M.&nbsp;Fierville (Introd. p.&nbsp;lxxvii. sq.) to have belonged to the
9th or 10th century, in which case it would take, if extant, at least
equal rank with the <i>Bernensis</i>. That it was an independent copy of
some older MS. seems to be proved, not only by the variants in the
<i>Pratensis</i>, but also by the fact that both the <i>Pratensis</i>
and the <i>Puteanus</i> (which is also a transcript of the
<i>Beccensis</i>) show a <i>lacuna</i> after the word <i>mutatis</i> in
<span class = "pagenum">lxii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxii" id = "intro_pagelxii"> </a>
x. 3, 32. This <i>lacuna</i> must have existed in the <i>Beccensis</i>,
though there is no trace of it elsewhere. Guided by the sense, Étienne
de Rouen added the words <i>correctum fuisse tabellis</i> in his copy
(the <i>Pratensis</i>): the text runs <i>codicibus esse
sublatum</i>.</p>

<p>The general character of the readings of the <i>Pratensis</i> may be
gathered from a comparison of passages in the Critical Appendix to this
volume. Among other variants, the following may be mentioned,&mdash;and
it will be seen that certain peculiar features in some of the MSS. used
by Halm (notably&nbsp;S) probably arose either from the <i>Pratensis</i>
or from its prototype, the <i>Beccensis</i>. At x. 1. 50 Prat, gives
(like&nbsp;S) <i>rogantis Achillen Priami precibus</i>, while most codd.
have <i>Priami</i> before <i>rogantis</i>: ib. §53 <i>eloquentie</i> (so
Put. S 7231, 7696) for <i>eloquendi</i>: ib. <i>superatum</i> (so Put.)
for <i>superari</i>: §55 <i>aequalem credidit parem</i> (as Put. S Harl.
2662, 11671): §67 <i>idque ego</i> (as Put.&nbsp;S) for <i>idque ego
sane</i>: §68 <i>qui fuerunt</i> and also <i>vero</i>, omitted (as in
Put.&nbsp;S): so also <i>tenebras</i> §72, <i>valuerunt</i> §84 (as
7231, 7696), and <i>veterum</i> §97: at §95 Prat, gives et
<i>eruditissimos</i> for <i>et doctissimos</i>, and hence the omission
of <i>erudit.</i> in&nbsp;S. On the whole, the study of the text of the
<i>Pratensis</i> seems to give additional confidence in the readings
of&nbsp;G: for example §98 <i>imperare</i> (as Put.): §101
<i>cesserit</i> (Put. 7231, 7696): ib. <i>nec indignetur</i>. Étienne de
Rouen carefully omitted all the Greek words which he found in his
original, and this strengthens the contention that <span class = "greek"
title = "phrasin">φράσιν</span> in 1&nbsp;§87 (see Crit. Notes, and cp.
§42) was originally written in Greek. At 2&nbsp;§20 <i>quem superius
institui</i> for <i>quem institueram in libra secundo</i> is an
indication of the fact that Étienne de Rouen was making a compendium of
the <i>Institutio</i>, and not transcribing the whole treatise. This
probably detracts from the significance of those readings which seem to
be peculiar to the <i>Pratensis</i>, among which may be noted 1&nbsp;§48
<i>putat</i> for <i>creditum est</i> (where Put. has
<i>certissimum</i>): §59 <i>ad exemplum maxime permanebit</i> (<i>ad
exitum</i> Put. and&nbsp;S): §78 <i>propinquior</i> for <i>propior</i>:
§80 <i>mediocri</i> for <i>medio</i>: §81 <i>assurgit</i> for
<i>surgit</i>: §109 <i>in utroque</i> for <i>in quoque</i>. Peculiar
readings which Prat. shares with the <i>Puteanus</i> (and which were
therefore probably in the <i>Beccensis</i>) are §46 <i>in magnis</i> for
<i>in magnis rebus</i>: §49 <i>innuit</i> for <i>nuntiat</i>: §50
<i>excessit</i> for <i>excedit</i>: §54 <i>ne virtus</i> for <i>ne
utrius</i> (<i>neutrius</i>): §57 <i>ignoro ergo</i> (S) for <i>ignoro
igitur</i>: §63 <i>plurimumque oratio</i>: §68 <i>in affectibus
communibus mirus</i>: §79 <i>discernendi</i> for <i>dicendi</i>: §107
<i>nominis latini</i> for <i>latini sermonis</i>. At 1&nbsp;§72 Prat.
has <i>qui ut a pravis sui temporis Menandro</i> (Put. <i>ut
pravis</i>), and this became in S Harl. 2662 and 11671 <i>qui quamvis
sui temp</i>. <i>Men.</i> There are frequent inversions, e.g. <i>dicendi
genere</i> §52 (Put.): <i>Attici sermonis</i> (Put.) §65: <i>plus
Attio</i> (Put.) §97: <i>cuicumque eorum Ciceronem</i> (as Put. 7231,
7696) §105: <i>sit nobis</i> §112:
<span class = "pagenum">lxiii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxiii" id = "intro_pagelxiii"> </a>
<i>est autem</i> (as Ioan.) §115: <i>forum illustrator</i> (as Ioan.)
§122: <i>creditus sum</i> §125: <i>dignis lectione</i> 2&nbsp;§1:
<i>possumus sperare</i> §9: <i>nemo vero eum</i> §10: <i>aliquo tamen in

3&nbsp;§8: <i>se res facilius</i> §9: <i>desperatio etiam</i> §14:

<p>From the list of readings given above, it will be seen that the
<i>Codex Puteanus</i> is in general agreement with the <i>Pratensis</i>,
each being an independent copy of the same original. The variants given
by this MS. will be found in the Critical Appendix for the part of the
Tenth Book collated by M.&nbsp;Fierville, 1&nbsp;§§46-107. At times it
is even more in agreement than the <i>Pratensis</i> with the later
family, of which Halm took S as the typical example: e.g. 1&nbsp;§61
<i>spiritu</i>: ib. <i>merito</i> omitted: §72 <i>possunt decernere</i>
(for <i>possis decerpere</i>&mdash;<i>possis decernere</i> Prat.).</p>

<p>In the arrangement introduced by Étienne de Rouen in the
<i>Pratensis</i>, the last two sections (§§79 and 80) consist
respectively of x. 1&nbsp;§§46-107, and xii. 10 §§10-15. These portions
of the <i>Institutio</i> must have formed part of the mutilated original
from which the <i>Beccensis</i> was copied, and they have been
reproduced separately along with 1&nbsp;§§108-131 in two Paris MSS.
(7231 and 7696), a collation of which has been put at my disposal by
M.&nbsp;Fierville. The first is a mixed codex of the 12th century,
containing nine separate works, of which the extracts from Quintilian
form one. The second, also of the 12th century, belonged to the Abbey of
Fleury-sur-Loire, and comprises five treatises besides the Quintilian.
In both the title runs Quintilianus, <i>libro Xº Inst. Orator. Qui
auctores Graecorum maxime legendi</i>. M.&nbsp;Fierville states (Introd.
p.&nbsp;lxxxv.) that of forty-five variants which he compared (x.
1&nbsp;§§46-68) in the <i>Pratensis</i>, <i>Puteanus</i>, 7231, and
7696, twenty-eight occur in the two former only, eight in the two
latter, and nine in all four. He adds that the <i>Vossiani</i> i. and
iii. resemble the two former more nearly than the two latter. Both 7231
and 7696 agree in giving the usual collocation at §50 <i>illis Priami
rogantis Achillen</i>: at §59 the former has <i>ad exim</i>, the latter
<i>ad exi</i>: at §61 both give <i>eum nemini credit</i>, omitting
<i>merito</i> (as Put. and&nbsp;S): at §68 <i>namque is et sermone</i>
(as Prat.: <i>namque sermone</i> Put.): ib. <i>in dicendo ac
respondendo</i> (Prat. Put. <i>in dicendo et in resp.</i>): §72
(apparently) <i>ut pravis sui temporis iudiciis</i>: §82 <i>finxisse
sermonem</i> (as Prat. Put. and most codd.): §83 <i>ac varietate</i>:
§88 <i>laudandus partibus</i> (<i>laudandis part.</i> Prat. Put. Harl.
2662, 11671): §91 <i>visum</i> (<i>visum est</i> Prat. Put.): §98
<i>senes
<span class = "pagenum">lxiv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxiv" id = "intro_pagelxiv"> </a>
non parum tragicum</i> (Prat. Put. Harl. 2662, 11671): §107 <i>Latini
nominis</i>: §121 <i>leve</i> (Prat.&nbsp;N). In §98 <i>Thyestes</i> is
omitted in both (also in Prat. Put.): is this a sign that the name was
written in Greek in the original? In 7231 I have noted two inversions
which do not seem to appear in 7696: <i>dedit exemplum et ortum</i>
1&nbsp;§46: <i>proximus aemulari</i>&nbsp;§62.</p>

<p>M. Fierville classifies the various members of the whole family of
MSS. which has just been reviewed in five sub-divisions. The first
includes the <i>Bernensis</i>, <i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;A,
<i>Ambrosianus</i>&nbsp;ii., <i>Pithoeanus</i> (these two are direct
copies of the <i>Bernensis</i>), <i>Salmantinus</i>, three Paris codices
(7720, 7722 and <i>Didot</i>), and probably the <i>Ioannensis</i>. In
the second he ranks the <i>Nostradamensis</i>, <i>Vossiani</i> i. and
iii., and a Paris MS. (7721): in the third the <i>Beccensis</i>,
<i>Pratensis</i>, and <i>Puteanus</i>: in the fourth a <i>codex
Vaticanus</i>, referred to by Spalding: and in the fifth the fragments
just dealt with (7231, 7696). Of these he rightly considers the
<i>Bernensis</i>, <i>Bambergensis</i>, <i>Nostradamensis</i>,
<i>Pratensis</i>, and <i>Puteanus</i> to be of greatest importance for
the constitution of the text.</p>


<p class = "space">
At the head of the third group of the manuscripts of Quintilian must now
be placed the <i>Codex Harleianus</i> (2664), in the library of the
British Museum<a class = "tag" name = "tag75" id = "tag75" href =
"#note75">75</a>. This manuscript was first described by Mr. L.&nbsp;C.
Purser in <i>Hermathena</i> (No. xii., 1886); and to his notice of it I
am now able to add a statement of its history and a pretty certain
indication of the relation it bears to other known codices. As to date,
it cannot be placed later than the beginning of the 11th century. There
are in the margin marks which show clearly that at an early date it was
used to supply the great <i>lacunae</i> in some MS. of the first or
incomplete class; one of these should have appeared in the margin of the
annexed facsimile, <i>a</i> being used at the beginning and <i>b</i> (as
here x. 1, 107) at the end of the parts to be extracted. The manuscript
contains 188 folios and 24 quaternions, and is written in one column. At
the beginning the writing is larger than subsequently, just as the first
part of the <i>Bambergensis</i> is larger than G, which the
<i>Harleianus</i> (H) closely resembles. On fols. 90-91 the hand is more
recent, and the writing is in darker ink: fols. 61-68 seem to have been
supplied later. There is a blank of eight lines at the end of 161v.,
where Book xi. ch. 1 concludes; ch. 2 begins at the top of the next
page. There is also a blank line (as in Bn and Bg) at iii. 8, 30, though
nothing is wanting in the text.</p>

<p>The result of my investigations has been to identify this important
manuscript with the <i>Codex Dusseldorpianus</i>, which we know
disappeared from the library at Düsseldorf before Gesner’s time. In the
preface to
<span class = "pagenum">lxv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxv" id = "intro_pagelxv"> </a>
his edition of 1738, §20, he describes it, on the evidence of one who
had seen it, as ‘Poggianis temporibus certe priorem, necdum, quod
sciatur, recentiori aetate a quoquam collatum’: its remarkable freedom
from variants and emendations suggests that it must have lain long
unnoticed. When Gesner wanted to refer to it, he found it was gone:
‘tandem compertum est mala fraude nescio quorum hominum et hunc et alios
rarissimos codices esse subductos.’ It had, in fact, been sold by the
Düsseldorf librarian, possibly acting under orders. The diary of
Humphrey Wanley, Harley’s librarian, shows that he bought it (along with
several other manuscripts) on the 6th August, 1724, from Sig. John James
Zamboni, Resident <i>Chargé d’Affaires</i> in England for the Elector of
Hesse Darmstadt. Zamboni’s correspondence is in the Bodleian at Oxford;
and I have ascertained, by examining it, that he received the Harleian
manuscript of Quintilian from M.&nbsp;Büchels, who was librarian of the
Court library at Düsseldorf in the beginning of last century, and with
whom Zamboni drove a regular trade in manuscripts.</p>

<p>‘The correspondence’ (to quote from what has already been written
elsewhere) ‘is of a very interesting character, and throws light on the
provenance of several of the Harleian MSS. The transactions of the pair
begin in 1721, when Büchels receives 1200 florins (not without much
dunning) for a consignment of printed books. Zamboni, who was something
of a humourist, is constantly endeavouring to beat down the librarian’s
prices: “j’aime les beaux livres,” he says on one occasion, when
pretending that he will not entertain a certain offer, “j’aime les beaux
livres, mais je ne hais pas l’argent.” The trade in MSS. began in 1724,
when Büchels sent a list from which Zamboni selected eleven codices,
assuring his correspondent that if he would only be reasonable they
would soon come to terms. Early in the year he offers 500 florins for
the lot, protesting that he had no intention of selling again: “sachez,
Monsieur, que je ne vous achète pas les livres pour les revendre.” Three
weeks after it came to hand, he made over the whole consignment to
Harley’s librarian. It included our Quintilian and the great
Vitruvius&mdash;the entries in Zamboni’s letters corresponding exactly
with those in Wanley’s diary. In the end of the same month Zamboni is
writing to Büchels for more, protesting that his great ambition is to
make a “très jolie collection” of MSS. (Bodl. MSS. Add.
D,&nbsp;66).’</p>

<p>What the history of the <i>Harleianus</i> may have been before it
came to Düsseldorf, I&nbsp;have been unable to ascertain. The only clue
is a scrawl on the first page: <i>Iste liber est maioris ecclesiae</i>.
This Mr. Purser has ascribed, with great probability, to Strasburg. The
<i>Codex Florentinus</i> has an inscription showing that it was given by
Bishop Werinharius (the
<span class = "pagenum">lxvi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxvi" id = "intro_pagelxvi"> </a>
first of that name, 1000-1029?) to the Cathedral of St.&nbsp;Mary at
Strasburg; and Wypheling, who made a catalogue of the library there
(circ. 1508), says of this bishop: ‘multa dedit ecclesiae suae
praesertim multos praestantissimos libros antiquissimis characteribus
scriptos; quorum adhuc aliqui in bibliotheca maioris ecclesiae repositi
videntur.’ This shows that there was a greater and a less church at
Strasburg, to the latter of which the MS. may formerly have belonged.
And if, as is now generally believed, neither the <i>Florentinus</i> nor
the <i>Turicensis</i> can be considered identical with the manuscript
which roused the enthusiasm of the literary world when Poggio discovered
it in 1416, it is not impossible that we may have recovered that
manuscript in the <i>Harleianus</i>, if we can conceive of its having
migrated from Strasburg to St.&nbsp;Gall.</p>

The following paragraph appeared in the book as a single-sheet
Addendum labeled “Place opposite p. lxvi.” Its original location
was therefore at the point “...the insertion at a wrong place in
the // text...” in the second paragraph after the Addendum.
</p>

<p>Writing in the ‘Neue Heidelberger Jahrbücher’ (1891, p.&nbsp;238
sqq.), Mr. A.&nbsp;C. Clark, of Queen’s College, Oxford, supplies some
very interesting information in regard to Zamboni’s purchases. It seems
that Zamboni was able to tell Lord Oxford’s librarian that the MSS.
which he was selling to him had originally belonged to Graevius; and by
comparing the Zamboni correspondence in the Bodleian Library with the
posthumous catalogue of Graevius’s library, Mr. Clark has now discovered
that Büchels was offering to Zamboni the entire MSS. collection of that
great scholar, which in this way ultimately found a home in the library
of the British Museum. Graevius died in 1703, and the Elector Johann
Wilhelm bought both his books and his manuscripts. The former he
presented to the library of the University of Heidelberg: the latter he
retained in his own library at Düsseldorf. In regard to the Harleian
codex of Quintilian, Mr. Clark’s theory is that it belonged formerly not
to Strasburg, but to the cathedral at Cologne, which is more than once
referred to as ‘maior ecclesia.’ Gesner must have been in error when he
said that this codex had not been recently collated (cp. Introd.
p.&nbsp;lxv); for Gulielmus had seen it at Cologne, and in his
‘Verisimilia,’ iii. xiv, quotes some variants and ‘proprii errores’ from
the preface to Book vi, all of which appear in the <i>Harleianus</i> as
we have it now. And as Graevius is known to have borrowed from the
library of Cologne Cathedral, in 1688, an important codex of Cicero ad
Fam. (Harl. 2682), Mr. Clark infers that he got the Quintilian at the
same time. He evidently omitted to return them; and after his death they
passed, with many other MSS., first to Düsseldorf, and then to
London.</p>

<p>It was only after the <i>Bambergensis</i> arrived in the British
Museum (where it was sent by the authorities of the Bamberg Library, in
courteous compliance with a request from me) that it was possible to
form a definite opinion as to the place occupied by the
<i>Harleianus</i> in regard to it. At first it appeared, even to the
experts, that the latter MS. was distinctly of older date than the
former: it is written in a neater hand, and on palaeographical grounds
alone there might have been room for doubt. But a fuller examination
convinced me that the <i>Harleianus</i> was copied directly from the
<i>Bambergensis</i>, possibly at the very time when the latter was being
completed by the addition of the parts known as
<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G, and of some at least of the readings now
generally designated <b>b</b>. These latter, indeed, the
<i>Harleianus</i> slavishly follows, in preference to the first hand in
the original <i>Bambergensis</i>: probably the copyist of the
<i>Harleianus</i> was aware of the importance attached to the codex
(uncial?) from which the <b>b</b> readings were taken. In view, however,
of the defective state in which the <i>Bambergensis</i> has come down to
us, as regards the opening part, and considering also the mutilation of
the <i>Ambrosianus</i>, we may still claim for the MS. in the British
Museum the distinction of being the oldest complete manuscript of
Quintilian in existence.</p>

<p>The proof that the <i>Harleianus</i> stands at the head of the great
family of the <i>mixed</i> manuscripts of Quintilian (represented till
now mainly by the <i>Florentinus</i>, <i>Turicensis</i>,
<i>Almeloveenianus</i>, and <i>Guelferbytanus</i>) is derived from a
consideration of its relationship to both parts of the
<i>Bambergensis</i> on the one hand, and to those later MSS. on the
other. I&nbsp;begin with a point which involves a testimony to the
critical acumen of that great scholar C.&nbsp;Halm. In the
<i>Sitzungsberichte der königl. bayer. Akademie der Wissenschaften zu
München</i>, 1866, i. pp.&nbsp;505-6, Halm established the dependence of
the <i>Turicensis</i> and the <i>Florentinus</i> on the
<i>Bambergensis</i> by pointing out, among other proofs, the insertion
at a wrong place in the
<span class = "pagenum">lxvii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxvii" id = "intro_pagelxvii"> </a>
text of both these codices of certain words which, having been
inadvertently omitted by the copyist of the <i>Bambergensis</i> from
their proper context, were written in by him in a blank space at the
foot of the page in which the passage in question occurs. The passage is
ix. 2, 52: <i>circa crimen Apollonii Drepani[tani: gaudeo etiam si quid
ab eo abstulisti et abs te] nihil rectius factum esse dico</i>. When the
copyist of the <i>Bambergensis</i> noticed his mistake, he completed
<i>Drepanitani</i> in the text, and wrote in the words <i>gaudeo etiam
... abs te</i> at the foot of the page, with a pretty clear indication
of the place where they were to be taken in. In the <i>Bambergensis</i>
the page ends with the words (§54) <i>an huius ille legis quam</i>, and
the next page continues <i>C̣ḷọẹlius a se inventam gloriatur</i>.
Noticing that in both the <i>Florentinus</i> and the <i>Turicensis</i>
the marginal addition (<i>gaudeo etiam ... abs te</i>) is inserted not
after <i>legis quam</i> but after <i>Clodius</i>, Halm drew the
inference that these codices were copied from the <i>Bambergensis</i>
not directly, but through some intervening manuscript. The
<i>Harleianus</i> is this manuscript. In it the words referred to do
come in between <i>legis quam</i> and (<i>Cloe</i>)<i>lius</i>: indeed,
so slavishly does the writer follow the second hand in the
<i>Bambergensis</i>, in which the letters C&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;e are
subpunctuated, that the <i>Harleianus</i> actually shows <i>et abs te
lius a se inventa</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag76" id = "tag76" href =
"#note76">76</a>, exactly as the writer of <b>b</b> wished the
<i>Bambergensis</i> to stand. It must be feared that the copyist of the
<i>Harleianus</i> did not know enough Latin to save him from making very
considerable mistakes. If I am right in believing that this manuscript
must take rank above the <i>Turicensis</i> and the <i>Florentinus</i>
(and all other MSS. of this family), it is he who must be credited with
a great deal of the confusion that has crept into Quintilian’s text. It
may be well to mention one or two obvious examples. In ix. 3, 1 the text
stands <i>utinamque non peiora vincant. Verum schemata</i>, &amp;c. In
the <i>Bambergensis</i>, <i>utrum nam</i> is supplied by <b>b</b> above
the line, and in the margin <i>que peiora vincant verum</i>, the words
affected by the change being
<span class = "pagenum">lxviii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxviii" id = "intro_pagelxviii"> </a>
subpunctuated in the text. The copyist of the <i>Harleianus</i> takes
the <i>utrum nam</i> and leaves the rest, showing <i>utrum nam
schemata</i>: this appears as <i>utrim nam schemata</i> in the
<i>Turicensis</i>, and as <i>utinam schemata</i> in the
<i>Florentinus</i> and <i>Almeloveenianus</i>. Take again ix. 3, 68-9 in
the <i>Bambergensis</i> (G) <i>quem suppli[catione dignum indicaris.
Aliter quoque voces aut] eadem aut diversa</i>, &amp;c. The words
enclosed in brackets are the last line of a particular column (142 v.);
they were inadvertently omitted by the copyist of the <i>Harleianus</i>,
and as a consequence we have <i>supplici</i> in <i>Turic.</i> and
<i>Flor.</i>, <i>supplitia</i> in <i>Guelf.</i>, &amp;c. Again at x. 7,
20 a certain sleepiness on the part of the scribe of the
<i>Harleianus</i>, which caused him to write <i>Neque vero tantas eum
breve saltem qui foro tempus quod nusquam fere deerit ad ea quae</i>,
&amp;c., has given rise to the greatest confusion in <i>Turic.</i>,
<i>Flor.</i>, <i>Alm.</i>, <i>Bodleianus</i>, <i>Burn.</i> 243, &amp;c.
In this H follows exactly the second hand in Bg., except for the
remarkable insertion of the words <i>qui foro</i> between <i>breve
saltem</i> and <i>tempus</i>: at this point the copyist of H must have
allowed his eyes to stray to the beginning of the previous line in Bg,
where the words <i>qui foro</i> hold a conspicuous position.
<i>Flor.</i> and <i>Tur.</i> repeat the mistake, except that the latter
gives <i>eum brevem</i> for <i>eum breve</i>. Again at the end of Book
ix, <i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G gives <i>ut numerum spondet flexisse non
arcessisse non arcessiti et coacti esse videantur</i>: this reading is
identical with that of the <i>Harleianus</i>, except that the latter for
<i>arcessiti</i> gives <i>arcessisti</i>, a deviation promptly
reproduced by the <i>Florentinus</i>, while the <i>Turicensis</i> shows
<i>accersisti</i>. Perhaps the most conclusive instance of all is the
following: at iv. 2, 128 the <i>Bambergensis</i> gives (for <span class
= "greek" title = "epidiêgêsis">ἐπιδιήγησις</span>) <span class =
"greek" title = "EPIDIÊTÊSEI">ΕΠΙΔΙΗΤΗϹΕΙ</span>: this appears in H as
<span class = "greek" title = "EPIDIÊSEI">ΕΠΙΔΙΗϹΕΙ</span> the seventh
and eighth letters having been inadvertently omitted by the copyist.
F&nbsp;makes this <span class = "greek" title =
"EPITHESIE">ΕΠΙΘΕϹΙΕ</span> and T shows <span class = "greek" title =
"EPITHSIS">ΕΠΙΘϹΙϹ</span> (<span class = "greek" title =

Bg (and&nbsp;G), H, T, and F, I&nbsp;have found H, if not always in

2,&nbsp;10 <i>discernamus</i> Bg, <i>discernantur</i> b,
<i>disnantur</i> H T, <i>desinantur</i>&nbsp;F. Noteworthy cases of the
close adherence of T to H are the following: <i>Empedoclena</i> i. 4, 4:
<i>vespueruginem</i> i. 7, 12: <i>tereuntur</i> i. 4, 27: <i>flex
his</i> x. 1,&nbsp;2: <i>gravissimus</i> x. 1,&nbsp;97: <i>ipsae
illae quae extorque eum credas</i> x. 1,&nbsp;110, where both also
give <i>trans usum</i> for <i>transversum</i>, and <i>non repe</i> for
non rapi: <i>morare refinxit finxit recipit</i> x. 3,&nbsp;6: <i>nam
quod cum isocratis</i> x. 4,&nbsp;4. In other instances the writer
of T has evidently tried to improve on the reading of H: e.g. in the
title of Book&nbsp;x, H&nbsp;gives an abbreviation which T mistakes for
<i><b>quo</b> enim <b>dandum</b></i>: also <i>extemporal facilitas</i>
which appears in T as <i>extempora vel facilitas</i>: x. 1,&nbsp;79
<i>ven iudicis</i> H (in mistake for <i>se non iud.</i>), which is made
by T into <i>venit iudicis</i>. Many similar instances could be cited in
regard to both T and F; the reading <i>tantum</i>, for instance, in x.
1,&nbsp;92, which occurs in both, has evidently arisen from H, which
here shows something that looks more like <i>tantum</i> than
<i>tacitum</i> (the reading of&nbsp;G). Again, in every
<span class = "pagenum">lxx</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxx" id = "intro_pagelxx"> </a>
place where Halm uses the formula ‘F&nbsp;T soli ex notis,’ H&nbsp;will

</p>
</div>

<p>With such evidence as has been given above, it is impossible to doubt
that the <i>Harleianus</i> must now take rank above both the manuscripts
which, before the appearance of Halm’s edition, held so prominent a
place in the criticism of Quintilian, the <i>Codex Florentinus</i> and
the <i>Codex Turicenis</i>. The former is an eleventh century MS., now
in the Laurentian library at Florence. On the first page is this
inscription: <i>Werinharius episcopus dedit Sanctae Mariae</i>: on the
last <i>Liber Petri de Medicis, Cos. fil.</i>: and below <i>Liber
sanctae Mariae ecclesiae Argñ.</i> (=&nbsp;Argentoratensis) <i>in
dormitorio</i>. There were two bishops of Strasburg bearing the name of
Werner: the first 1001-1029, and the second 1065-1079. M.&nbsp;Fierville
(Introd. p.&nbsp;xciv) tells us that the first Werner (of Altemburg or
Hapsburg) laid the foundations of the cathedral at Strasburg in 1015,
and presented to the Chapter a number of valuable books; and we also
know that in 1006 he had attended the Council at Frankfort to promote
the erection of a cathedral church at Bamberg. Here then we have the
elements of a solution of the problem. Bishop Werner was a patron of
letters; and learning that by the addition of what is now known as
<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G a complete text of Quintilian had been
secured, he had it copied. The <i>Codex Harleianus</i> was in all
probability the first copy, and from it the <i>Codex Florentinus</i> was
reproduced. The latter was still at Strasburg in 1372, a fact which
(though hitherto it seems to have been unnoticed) is enough to dispose
of its claim to be considered the manuscript of Poggio, which he
describes as ‘plenum situ’ and ‘pulvere squalentem’ lying ‘in teterrimo
quodam et obscuro carcere, fundo scilicet unius turris, quo ne capitales
quidem rei damnati retruderentur.’ If so important a MS. had passed from
Strasburg to St.&nbsp;Gall within forty years of Poggio’s visit, it is
hard to believe that it would have been allowed to lie neglected and
unknown. After 1372 we know nothing certain of its history till it
reappears in the library of the Medicis at Florence in the latter part
of the fifteenth century. It is generally supposed that some time
between 1372 and 1417 it must have been transported from Strasburg to
the monastery of St.&nbsp;Gall, and that it passed from there to
Florence after Poggio’s departure. A&nbsp;similar theory may quite as
legitimately be maintained in reference to the <i>Harleianus</i>, which,
as I have
<span class = "pagenum">lxxi</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxxi" id = "intro_pagelxxi"> </a>
already indicated, may be the very manuscript which Poggio discovered at
St.&nbsp;Gall in 1416<a class = "tag" name = "tag78" id = "tag78" href =
"#note78">78</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Codex Turicensis</i> was long considered to be of older date
than the <i>Florentinus</i>, but recent investigations seem to have
proved the contrary. Halm attributes it to the second part of the
eleventh century, and E.&nbsp;Wölfflin takes a similar view. In the
beginning of the eighteenth century it passed into the library at
Zürich. Spalding believed it to be the manuscript discovered by Poggio,
and M.&nbsp;Fierville is of the same opinion: Halm rejects this theory.
The great point in favour of the claim of the <i>Turicensis</i> is that
it is known to have come from St.&nbsp;Gall, while we can only
conjecture the history of the <i>Harleianus</i>. But the
<i>Turicensis</i> cannot have been the MS. which Poggio carried with him
into Italy, according to a statement made by Bandini, Regius, and
others. It is true that this statement is hard to reconcile with what
Poggio himself says in his letter to Guarini, whom he informs that he
has made hasty transcripts of his various ‘finds’ (presumably including
the Quintilian) for his friends Leonardo of Arezzo and Nicolai of
Florence. But Poggio may have had his own reasons for a certain degree
of mystery about his good fortune. In the preface to his edition,
Burmann speaks of the manuscript of St.&nbsp;Gall, on the authority of
the librarian Kesler, as having been ‘honesto furto sublatum’: if it was
the <i>Harleianus</i> there is perhaps little need to wonder that
nothing has been known till now of its later fortunes<a class = "tag"
name = "tag79" id = "tag79" href = "#note79">79</a>.</p>

<p class = "space">
The affiliation of other MSS. of this class (which includes also the
<i>Almeloveenianus</i>) to the codices which have just been described,
may be determined by the application of certain tests. Prominent among
such MSS. is the <i>Codex Bodleianus</i>, which has received more
attention from editors of Quintilian than its merits seem to me to
warrant. It repeats word for word the remarkable error attributable to
the <i>Harleianus</i> at x. 7,&nbsp;20 (see above, p.&nbsp;lxviii): in
other places it embodies attempted emendations, e.g. x. 1,&nbsp;90
<i>nec ipsum senectus maturavit</i>: 2&nbsp;§7 <i>de metris</i> for
<span class = "pagenum">lxxii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxxii" id = "intro_pagelxxii"> </a>
<i>dimiteris</i> (see above, p. lxvii, note). It belonged to Archbishop
Laud, and must have been written in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Of the same age and family are two manuscripts often cited by Halm,
the <i>Lassbergensis</i> and the <i>Monacensis</i>. The former was
formerly at Landsberg in Bavaria: it is now at Freiburg. The reading
<i>atque interrogationibus atque interrogantibus</i>, which Halm gives
from it alone at x. 1,&nbsp;35, I&nbsp;have found also in G
and&nbsp;H; this seems quite enough to identify its parentage. The
<i>Monacensis</i> was collated by Halm for his critical edition in the
parts where he had to rely on A G or on G alone: with no conspicuous
results,&mdash;‘nihil fere aliud effectum est quam ut docere possemus,
ubi aliquot locorum, qui in libris melioribus leviter corrupti sunt,
emendatio primum tentata sit’ (praef. viii, ix).</p>

<p>Alongside of these I would place a rather interesting MS. in the
British Museum, which has been collated specially for the purpose of
this edition, with no result worth speaking of, except to establish its
class. It repeats the mistake of H at x. 7, 20: and the fact that the
copyist began his work in a hand that was meant to imitate writing of
the eleventh century seems, along with the internal evidence, to prove
that it is one of the copies of Poggio’s MS. In x. 2, 7 it has
<i>posterius</i> for <i>historiis</i> (a&nbsp;mistake in H&mdash;see
p.&nbsp;lxix): and in the same place it shows (like the Bodleian codex)
<i>de metris</i> for <i>dimiteris</i>. This is also the reading of the
second hand in the <i>Turicensis</i>. Such differences as exist between
it and H&nbsp;F&nbsp;T may be ascribed to attempted emendation: e.g.
<i>vertere latus</i> x. 3, 21. Poggio’s letter to Guarini is copied at
the end of the volume.</p>

<p>The other MSS. of the fifteenth century, so far as they are known to
him, M.&nbsp;Fierville divides carefully into two classes (his third and
fourth). The principal features of difference which distinguish them
among themselves, and from those already mentioned, are that they
incorporate, in varying degrees, the results of the progress of
scholarship, and that they are seldom copied from any single manuscript.
A&nbsp;detailed examination would no doubt establish what is really the
point of greatest moment in regard to them: how far are they derived,
through Poggio’s manuscript, from the <i>Bambergensis</i>, and how far
from such complete manuscripts as the <i>Ambrosianus</i> and the
original of <i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G? Some of them (as well as other
fifteenth century MSS., with a description of which I desire to
supplement M.&nbsp;Fierville’s Introduction, pp.&nbsp;cii sq.), are of
at least as great importance as those referred to above as having been
collated in part by Halm.</p>

<p>The <i>Argentoratensis</i> (S), also used by Halm, may be mentioned
first: it was collated by Obrecht for his edition of 1698<a class =
"tag" name = "tag80" id = "tag80" href = "#note80">80</a>. This
manuscript was
<span class = "pagenum">lxxiii</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxxiii" id = "intro_pagelxxiii"> </a>
destroyed in the bombardment of Strasburg, August 24, 1870. Then there
are the MS. of Wolfenbuttel (<i>Codex Guelferbytanus</i>), collated for
the first time by Spalding: the <i>Codex Gothanus</i>, used by Gesner
for his edition of 1738: the <i>Codex Vallensis</i> (Parisinus 7723),
which purports to bear the signature of Laurentius Valla
(9&nbsp;December, 1444), whose corrections and marginal notes it
contains<a class = "tag" name = "tag81" id = "tag81" href =
"#note81">81</a>. The list of these and several others, all carefully
described by M.&nbsp;Fierville, may now be extended by a short reference
to various MSS. in this country, hitherto uncollated. The results of my
examination of them (as well as of the <i>Bodleianus</i>, and
<i>Burneianus</i> 243, referred to above) appear in the Critical
Appendix: if few of them are of first-class importance, it may at least
be claimed that right readings, with which Spalding, Halm, and Meister
have successively credited the early printed editions,&mdash;e.g. the
Cologne edition of 1527,&mdash;have now been attributed to earlier
sources. And when M.&nbsp;Fierville had so carefully examined the MSS.
of France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain, it seemed of some
importance that his laborious work should be supplemented by a
description of the MSS. belonging to the libraries of this country.</p>

<p>In the British Museum there are eight manuscripts in all of
Quintilian’s <i>Institutio</i>: of the most important of these, the
<i>Harleianus</i> (H), I&nbsp;have already given an account, and one of
two MSS. in Burney’s collection (Burn. 243) has also been mentioned. Of
the remaining MSS. two may be taken together, as they are in complete
agreement with each other, and show conclusive proofs (as will appear in
the notes) of relationship to such codices as the <i>Argentoratensis</i>
and the <i>Guelferbytanus</i>. The first of these two MSS. (<i>Codex
Harleianus</i> 2662) has an inscription bearing that it was written by
Gaspar Cyrrus ‘nationis Lutatiae,’ and was finished on the 25th of
January, 1434,&mdash;only eighteen years after Poggio made his great
discovery. So great an advance is evident in the text, as compared with
the readings of H F&nbsp;T, that it seems probable that this MS. owes
little to that family. The same may be said of the <i>Codex
Harleianus</i> 11,671, a beautiful little quarto, dated 1467: it has the
Epitome of Fr. Patrizi attached (see Classical Review, 1891,
p.&nbsp;34). The following cases of remarkable errors will suffice to
connect both these MSS. with the <i>Guelferbytanus</i>: x. 3,&nbsp;12
<i>a patrono suo</i> for <i>a patruo suo</i>: 1&nbsp;§97 <i>verum</i>
for <i>veterum</i>: 1&nbsp;§55 <i>equalem credidit parem</i> (as also
Prat., Guelf., S, and Voss. i.
<span class = "pagenum">lxxiv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxxiv" id = "intro_pagelxxiv"> </a>
and iii.): 1&nbsp;§72 <i>quamvis sui temporis Menandro</i> for <i>ut
pravis sui temporis iudiciis Menandro</i>: 7&nbsp;§6 <i>adducet
ducetur</i>. Another very interesting MS. in the British Museum is
<i>Harleianus</i> 4995, dated July 5, 1470: it contains the notes of
Laurentius Valla, which were frequently reproduced at the time, and
might be classed along with the <i>Vallensis</i> were it not that a
marginal note at x. 6,&nbsp;2 (where a false lacuna appears in most
codices, as Bn. and Bg.), ‘<i>hic deficit antiquus codex</i>,’ makes it
probable that the copyist had more than one MS. at his side<a class =
"tag" name = "tag82" id = "tag82" href = "#note82">82</a>. This MS.
agrees with the <i>Vallensis</i> and <i>Gothanus</i> in reading
<i>cognitioni</i> for <i>cogitationi</i> x. 1,&nbsp;1:
<i>ubertate</i> for <i>ubertas</i> 1&nbsp;§109: <i>et vis summa</i>
§117: <i>eruendas</i> for <i>erudiendas</i> 2&nbsp;§6: <i>nobis
efficiendum</i> ib. §14: <i>decretoriis</i> 5&nbsp;§20. The other two
Harleian MSS. (4950 and 4829) present no features of special interest:
I&nbsp;have, however, included them in the critical notes for the sake
of completeness. The former was written by ‘Franciscus de Mediolano’: it
is often in agreement with the <i>Lassbergensis</i>. The latter finishes
with the words <span class = "greek" title = "hê biblos tou sôzomenou">ἡ
βίβλος τοῦ σωζομένου</span> and the motto <span class = "greek" title =
"agathê tuchê">ἀγαθῇ τύχῃ</span>. The readings of the <i>Burneianus</i>
244 are also occasionally recorded in the notes. All three are in
general agreement with&nbsp;L, and also with the <i>Codex
Carcassonensis</i>, a fifteenth century MS. of which M.&nbsp;Fierville
published a collation in 1874.</p>

<p>A greater degree of interest attaches to two Oxford manuscripts, one
of which (the <i>Codex Balliolensis</i>) is unclassed by Fierville,
while the other (the <i>D’Orville</i> MS.) has never been examined at
all. The former was used by Gibson for his edition of 1693. It begins at
<i>bis vitiosa sunt</i> i. 5, 14, but there are various lacunae, which
do not correspond with those of the incomplete family. The MS. is in
fact in a mutilated condition.
<span class = "pagenum">lxxv</span>
<a name = "intro_pagelxxv" id = "intro_pagelxxv"> </a>
In the Tenth Book we miss its help after the end of the first chapter
till we reach iii. §26, where it begins again with the words <i>quam
quod somno supererit</i>: it stops abruptly at <i>nostrorumque
Hort(ensium)</i> x. 6,&nbsp;4. It is in general agreement with
Harleianus 2662. I&nbsp;may note that in i. 5, 36 it has
<i>interrogatione</i>, a reading which Halm says appears for the first
time in the edition of Sichardus, 1529: ib. §69 it has <i>e rep</i> with
A and 7727, with the latter of which it is in close correspondence (e.g.
<i>forte</i> at i. 5, 15, all other codices <i>forsan</i> or
<i>forsitan</i>).</p>

<p>There remains the <i>D’Orville</i> MS. in the Bodleian at Oxford
(<i>Codex Dorvilianus</i>),&mdash;a manuscript which has been entirely
overlooked, except for a single reference in Ingram’s abridged edition
of the <i>Institutio</i> (1809). Yet it seems well deserving of
attention. In some places it shows a remarkable resemblance to the
<i>Ambrosianus</i> (e.g. <i>Getae</i> 1 pr. §6: <i>et quantum</i>
ib.&nbsp;§8): at 1 pr. §4 it has <i>summam inde eloquentiae</i>
(Spalding’s reading, found in no other MS.): <i>destinabamus al.
festinabimus</i> ib. §6 (the alternative being a reading peculiar
to&nbsp;A). Its most important contribution to the Tenth Book is
7&nbsp;§20, where it gives the reading which Herzog conjectured and
which I have received into the text: <i>neque vero tanta esse unquam
debet fiducia facilitatis</i>: in 2&nbsp;§14 (see Critical Notes) it has
<i>quos eligamus ad imitandum</i>, a reading peculiar to itself. For the
rest it is in general agreement with the Balliol codex. It is Italian
work, of the early part of the fifteenth century,&mdash;earlier, Mr.
Madan thinks, than the <i>Codex Bodleianus</i>. A&nbsp;marginal note at
ix. 3, 2 shows that the copyist must have had more than one MS. before
him. In some cases it would appear as if he carefully balanced rival
readings: at 1 pr. §12. all codices have <i>quaestio ex his incidat</i>
except&nbsp;A, which gives <i>ex his incidat quaestio</i>: the reading
in the <i>Dorvilianus</i> is <i>quaestio incidat ex his</i>: again at i.
2, 6 <i>ante palatum eorum quam os instituimus</i>, many codices give
<i>mores</i> for <i>os</i>: Dorv. shows <i>quam vel mores vel
os</i>.</p>

Hild, Introd. pp. xiii.-xiv, where passages are cited from contemporary
literature describing both types. For the first cp. Martial viii. 16
<i>Pistor qui fueras diu, Cipere, Nunc causas agis</i>, and
<i>passim</i>: Petronius, Sat. 46 <i>destinavi illum artificii docere,
aut tonstrinum aut praeconem aut certe causidicum</i> ... Philero was
lately a street porter: <i>nunc etiam adversus Norbanum se extendit;
litterae thesaurum est, et artificium numquam moritur</i>: Juv. vii. 106
sqq.: Plin. v. 13, 6 sq.: vi. 29. Of the second class the best
representative is Aquilius Regulus, informer and legacy-hunter, on whose
account Herennius Senecio parodied Cato’s famous utterance, <i>vir malus
dicendi imperitus</i> Plin. iv. 7, 5 and ii. 20.</p>

<i>Di, maiorum umbris tenuem et sine pondere terram Spirantesque crocos

i. pr. §1 <i>post impetratam studiis meis quietem quae per viginti annos
erudiendis iuvenibus impenderam</i>. The chronology is rather uncertain.
It is supposed that Quintilian began his <i>Institutio</i> in 92 or 93
and finished it in 94 or 95. If the period of twenty years is to be
interpreted rigorously, we may suppose that he is referring to his
official career, as it may have been in 72 that Vespasian took the step
referred to above, p.&nbsp;viii. Or we may understand him to be dating
the period of his educational activity as extending from <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 70 to <span class = "smallroman"><ins class =
"correction" title = "period invisible">A.</ins>D.</span> 90, though he
did not begin to write the <i>Institutio</i> till 92. The latter is the
more probable alternative.</p>

The <i>Declamationes</i> may also be mentioned here, as having long been
credited to Quintilian: they consist of 19 longer and 145 shorter
pieces. That Quintilian practised this form of rhetorical exercise, and
with success,&mdash;at least in the earlier part of his career,&mdash;is
clear from such passages as xi. 2, 39: but it seems probable, from the
nature of the contents of the existing collection, if not from the
style, that tradition has erred in attributing to the master what must
have been, in the main, the work of pupils and imitators. The popular
habit of tacking on to a great name whatever seems not unworthy of it,
may account for the fact that these rhetorical efforts are credited to
Quintilian as early as the time of Ausonius, who says (Prof. 1,&nbsp;15)
<i>Seu libeat fictas ludorum evolvere lites Ancipitem palmam
Quintilianus habet</i>. St.&nbsp;Jerome, on Isaiah viii. praef., speaks
of his <i>concinnas declamationes</i>: Lactantius i. 24 quotes one which
has disappeared from the collection; and lastly, Trebellius Pollio, a
historian of the age of Diocletian, speaking of a certain Postumus, of
Gaulish origin, adds: <i>fuit autem ... ita in declamationibus disertus
ut eius controversiae Quintiliano dicantur insertae</i> (Trig. tyr.
4,&nbsp;2): cp. ib. <i>Quintiliano, quem declamatorem Romani generis
acutissimum vel unius capitis lectio prima statim fronte demonstrat</i>

If they had still been under Quintilian’s care when he wrote the
Introduction to the Sixth Book (where referring to his domestic losses
he says that he will live henceforth not to himself but to the youth of
Rome), he would almost certainly have made some reference to them.</p>

<p><a name = "note14" id = "note14" href = "#tag14">14.</a>
In judging Quintilian we must not forget that similar extravagances have
not been unknown in our own literature. His translator, Guthrie&mdash;an
Aberdonian Scot, who is full of enthusiasm for his author&mdash;cries
out in a note on this passage: “I will engage to point out from the
works of some of the greatest and most learned men, as well as of the
best poets, of England, compliments to the abilities not only of
princes, but of noblemen, statesmen, nay, private gentlemen, who in this
respect deserved them as little as Domitian did.”</p>

<p><a name = "note15" id = "note15" href = "#tag15">15.</a>
The expression used in vi. pr. §4, <i>meo casu cui tamen nihil obici
nisi quod vivam potest</i>, shows that Quintilian was quite conscious of
his comfortable circumstances.&mdash;Halm (followed by Meister) reads
<i>quam</i> quod vivam: but I find <i>nisi</i> in both the Bamberg (G)
and the Harleian codices.</p>

<p><a name = "note16" id = "note16" href = "#tag16">16.</a>
Some have supposed that Quintilian made a second marriage (sometime
between 93 and 95), after losing his wife and two children. This theory,
which is rejected now by Mommsen, Teuffel, and most authorities, was
invented to account for the existence of a grown-up daughter, to whom,
on the occasion of her marriage (about the year 105), Pliny gives a
present of 50,000 sesterces: Ep. vi. 32. But this young lady must have
been the daughter of another Quintilianus altogether. What we know of
our Quintilian’s affluent circumstances is inconsistent with such
liberality on Pliny’s part: the gift is offered as to a man who is
comparatively poor. Moreover, the letter intimating the gift contains no
such reference to the services of a former teacher as might have been
expected on so interesting an occasion. And lastly it is almost
inconceivable that Quintilian, after bewailing in the Introduction to
Book vi. (about 93 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>) the
bereavements that left him desolate (<i>superstes omnium meorum</i>),
should have had twelve years afterwards a daughter of marriageable
age.</p>

<i>Utinam ... orator hanc artem superbo nomine et vitiis quorundam bona

these and other passages evidence of a bias against the representatives
of philosophy on the part of Quintilian, which must have worked as
powerfully in the case of a teacher of youth as the more open
denunciations of Juvenal and Martial. He even finds traces of
Quintilian’s influence with Domitian in the banishment of the
philosophers from Rome in <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 94. It

Quintilian’s ‘somewhat pretentious moral overture’ (<i>vir bonus dicendi

have thought it a necessary virtue in a <i>bonus grammaticus</i> to read
and conscientiously study the Greek authors on whom he passes formal
critical judgments. For it is, alas! too plain that, whether Quintilian
had or had not read them, he contents himself in many cases with merely

In discussing Quintilian’s language and style, it must not be forgotten
that he was a Spaniard by birth. In his recent pamphlet, ‘Ueber die
Substantivierung des Adjectivums bei Quintilian’ (Berlin, 1890), Dr.
Paul Hirt quotes an interesting remark of Filelfo (cp. G.&nbsp;Voigt,
‘Wiederbelebung des klass. Alt.’ i. p.&nbsp;467 note), which has lately
received some corroboration: <i>sapit hispanitatem nescio quam, hoc est
barbariem plane quandam</i>. Filelfo did not like Quintilian: <i>nullam
habet elegantiam, nullum nitorem, nullam suavitatem. Neque movet dicendo
Quintilianus, neque satis docet, nec delectat.</i> But this was only
Filelfo’s opinion, for which he would not have been able to furnish such
scientific grounds as that lately (Archiv. f. Lat. Lex. und Gramm. 1
p.&nbsp;356) supplied by Dr. E.&nbsp;Wölfflin, in regard to the
adjective <i>pandus</i>. This word was in use in the days of Ennius, and
occurs often afterwards in poetry, but not in prose. In Spain, however,
it lingered, and is used by Seneca, Martial, Silius, Columella, and
especially by Quintilian. After these writers it disappears again till
the fourth century.&mdash;Cp. i. 5, 57 <i>gurdos, quos pro stolidis
accipit vulgus, ex Hispania duxisse originem audivi</i>, which has been
quoted (by Abbé Gédoyn, and by Hermann, following Gesner) strangely
enough in disproof of Quintilian’s Spanish birth.</p>

Schmalz (Ueber den Sprachgebrauch des Asinius Pollio, p.&nbsp;52) says
that this usage, which is a favourite one with Pollio ad Fam. x. 32, 5
<i>Gallum Cornelium</i>), was first introduced by Varro (L.&nbsp;Lat. 5,
83 <i>Scaevola Quintus</i>: de Re Rust. i. 2, 1 <i>Libo Marcius</i>). It
is frequent in Cicero’s correspondence, and became general in Velleius
Paterculus.</p>

Halm’s account of this is more accurate than Meister’s. The former
(Praef. p.&nbsp;viii) says <i>magnae autem lacunae Bernensis pergamenis
insertis ex alio codice suppletae sunt</i>. The <i>alius codex</i> which
the writer of G had at hand is no longer extant: it no doubt belonged to
the same family as the <i>Ambrosianus</i>, and
<i>Bambergensis</i>&nbsp;G is consequently of first-class importance,
especially where the <i>Ambrosianus</i> fails us. It is incorrect to say
(with Meister, Praef. p.&nbsp;vi) <i>lacunae pergamenis ex alieno codice
insertis expletae sunt</i>. The writer of G did not mutilate another
codex in order to complete Bg: in some places he begins his copy on the
blank space left at the end of a folio in&nbsp;Bg.</p>

The <i>Pratensis</i> is the oldest authority for the reading <i>tam
laesae hercule</i> at i. 2, 4: the <i>Puteanus</i> and <i>Ioannensis</i>
agree. Again all three omit the words <i>de litteris</i> at i. 4, 6, and
show <i>praecoquum</i> for <i>praecox</i> at i. 3, 3 (so Voss. iii. and
7760), and <i>haec igitur ex verbis</i> at i. 5, 2 (so Voss. iii.).</p>

The subpunctuation of these letters by the second hand by the
<i>Bambergensis</i> is a phenomenon which may, I&nbsp;think, be
explained in this way. The codex from which the readings known as
<b>b</b> are taken must have been of considerable antiquity, and
probably abounded in contractions: <i>lius</i> may have seemed to the
copyist the nearest approach to what he had before him, wherefore he
subpunctuated Cloe. Cloelius in the <i>Bambergensis</i> is a very
intelligible mistake for Clodius. Another example of a similar mistake
on the part of the writer of b occurs at x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec7">2,&nbsp;7</a>, where the
Bambergensis now shows <i>id consequi q̣ụọd imiteris</i>, the writer of
b having subpunctuated <i>quo</i> because he did not understand the
contraction for <i>quod</i> which he had in the text before him. The
copyist of the Harleianus at once follows suit, and hence the remarkable
reading <i>id consequi dimiteris</i>, which in the Bodleianus and other
MSS. becomes <i>de metris</i> (see Crit. Note ad loc.). In fact, it
seems that much of the corruption which has prevailed in the text of
Quintilian is due to the fact that <b>b</b> very often did not
understand what he was doing, and that through such codices as followed
his guidance his errors became perpetuated. Cp. <i>totas at cures</i>
(for <i>vires</i>&nbsp;<b>b</b>) <i>suas</i> in the second last line of
the Facsimile (x.

The only places in the Tenth Book which form any obstacle to the theory
that H was copied directly from the Bambergensis are the following: x.
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec33">3,&nbsp;33</a>, where the
remarkable gloss <i>vindemoni</i> occurs (repeated in F but not
in&nbsp;T): see Crit. Notes ad loc. for an attempted explanation: x.

himself: and x.

The claim of the Codex Florentinus to be Poggio’s manuscript was
definitely rejected by A.&nbsp;Reifferscheid in the <i>Rheinisches
Museum</i>, xxiii (1868), pp.&nbsp;143-146. Reifferscheid refers to a
Codex Urbinas (577), an examination of which would probably settle the
question, if it is what it professes to be, a transcript of Poggio’s
manuscript. It bears the following inscription: <i>Scripsit Poggius
Florentinus hunc librum Constantiae diebus LIII sede apostolica vacante.
Reperimus vero eum in bibliotheca monasterii sancti galli quo plures
litterarum studiosi perquirendorum librorum causa accessimus ex quo
plurimum utilitalis eloquentiae studiis comparatum putamus, cum antea
Quintilianum neque integrum neque nisi lacerum et truncum plurimis locis
haberemus. Hec verba ex originali Poggii sumpta.</i></p>

Since the above was written the readings of the <i>Vallensis</i> have
been given in detail for the Tenth Book by Becher (<i>Programm des
königlichen Gymnasiums zu Aurich</i>, Easter, 1891). With the exception
of <i>Harl.</i> 4995, no other fifteenth century codex furnishes so
correct a text; and it is interesting to speculate whether the
improvements are due to the progress of scholarship since Poggio’s
discovery, or to the fact that the <i>Vallensis</i> and <i>Harl.</i>
4995 derive, not from the class of MSS. to which Poggio’s belonged, but
from some other and more reliable codex. If the latter was copied from
the former, it will afford a test, such as Becher desiderates, for
discriminating between the corrections made in the <i>Vallensis</i>.
Those not adopted in <i>Harl.</i> 4995 were made, in all probability,
after 1470. For example in 1. §23 <i>utile erit</i>
(<i>Vall.</i><sup>2</sup>) does not appear in the London manuscript,
which also has <i>audatiora</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec4">5&nbsp;§4</a>: <i>nobis ac</i>
and <i>uno genere</i> ib. §7: <i>virtutum</i> ib. §17: <i>recidere</i>
ib. §22: <i>diligenter effecta</i>, (without <i>una enim</i>) ib. §23:
<i>iniicere</i>
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec29">7&nbsp;§29</a>. In all these
places there are corrections by a later hand in the <i>Vallensis</i>.
But in the following passages, among others, the copyist of <i>Harl.</i>
4995 adopts corrections which had already been made in the
<i>Vallensis</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec9">1&nbsp;§9</a> <i>quae cultiore in
parte</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec19">§19</a> <i>iteratione</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec31">§31</a> <i>molli</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec38">§38</a> <i>exequar</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec107">§107</a> <i>qui duo plurimum
affectus valent</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec117">§117</a> <i>et vis summa</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec125">§125</a> <i>tum</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec15">2&nbsp;§15</a> <i>dicunt</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec17">§17</a> <i>quam libet</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec2">3&nbsp;§2</a> <i>et fundit</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec6">§6</a> <i>scriptorum</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec17">§17</a> <i>contextis quae fudit
levitas</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec21">§21</a> <i>simul vertere
latus</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec31">§31</a> <i>crebra relatione</i>:
<a href = "QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec12">5&nbsp;§12</a> <i>de <ins class
= "correction" title = "second letter unclear: primary text has ‘re’">reo</ins></i>:
<a href = "QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec25">§25</a> <i>utilior</i>.
A&nbsp;comparison of the two codices might possibly reveal the fact that
the writer of <i>Harl.</i> 4995 is himself the author of some of the
emendations in the <i>Vallensis</i>. Was he J.&nbsp;Badius?</p>
