<p><span class = "smallcaps">This</span> volume has grown in my hands
during the last eighteen months. If I had contented myself with a short
commentary, it might have appeared sooner and in a slighter form. But in
addition to the full and careful illustration required for the matter of
Quintilian’s Tenth Book, the criticism of the text has become so
important as to call for separate treatment. It has engaged, within
recent years, a large share of the attention of some of the foremost
scholars on the Continent. Even while this volume was passing through
the press, fresh evidence of their continued activity was received in
the shape of two valuable papers&mdash;an article by Moriz Kiderlin in
one of the current numbers of the <i>Rheinisches Museum</i>, and
Becher’s ‘Zum zehnten Buch des Quintilianus’ in the <i>Programm des
Königlichen Gymnasiums zu Aurich</i> for Easter, 1891. The latter I have
found especially interesting, as confirming many of the conclusions at
which, with the help of one of the manuscripts in the British Museum
(Harl. 4995), I&nbsp;had arrived in regard to textual difficulties.</p>

<p>The importance ascribed to another English codex (Harl. 2664) will,
I&nbsp;venture to think, be held to be justified by the account of it
given in the Introduction. After I had examined it for myself, a
collation of it was kindly put at my disposal by Mr. L.&nbsp;C. Purser,
of Trinity College, Dublin, to whom I take this opportunity of rendering
my best thanks. I&nbsp;am indebted also to M.&nbsp;Ch.&nbsp;Fierville,
Censeur des études au Lycée Charlemagne, for sending me his collation of
four important Paris
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
manuscripts (Pratensis, Puteanus, 7231 and 7696), and also of the
Spanish Salmantinus. As to the other codices which I have been at the
trouble of collating personally, it will not be imagined that any
mistaken estimate has been formed of their value. If some of them throw
little fresh light on existing difficulties, they have each a bearing on
the history of the constitution of the text; and it seemed desirable to
complete, by some account of them, the elaborate description of the
Manuscripts of Quintilian given by M.&nbsp;Fierville in his latest
volume.</p>

<p>A reference to the list of authorities consulted will show the extent
of the obligations incurred to other editors and critics. Kruger’s third
edition has been especially useful. And though Professor Mayor’s
commentary extends only to the fifty-sixth section of the first chapter,
I&nbsp;trust I have profited by the example of scholarly thoroughness
which he set me in the part of the work which he was able to overtake.
His Analysis has also been largely followed.</p>

<p>For convenience of reference, a table of places has been added in
which the text of this edition differs from that of Halm and of Meister.
Special attention has been paid to the matter of punctuation, in regard
to which German methods have not been adopted.</p>

<p>One or two of my own conjectural emendations I have presumed to
insert in the text, and others are suggested in the Critical Notes.
Perhaps the most important is <i>sic dicere</i> for the MS.
<i>inicere</i> at 7 §29.</p>

<p>If my volume should strike any student as having been prepared on too
elaborate a scale, I&nbsp;trust it will be remembered that Quintilian is
a neglected author, for whom nothing has been done in this country (with
the exception of Professor Mayor’s incomplete edition of the Tenth Book)
since the beginning of the present century. Perhaps its publication may
help to clear the way for a final issue of the whole text of the
<i>Institutio</i>.</p>

<span class = "subhead">
How to acquire a command of Diction.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec1">1-4.</a>
The question whether a ready command of speech is best acquired by
writing, or by reading, or by speaking, is of little practical
importance, all three being indispensable. But what is theoretically
most indispensable does not necessarily take first rank for the purpose
of practical oratory. Speaking comes first: then imitation (§8 and
ch.&nbsp;ii), including reading and hearing: lastly, writing (chs.
iii-v). That is the order of development&mdash;not necessarily the order
of importance. The early training of the orator has been overtaken in
the first two books. We have now to deal, not with the theory of
rhetoric, but with the best methods of applying theory to practice.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec5">5-15.</a>
The necessary store of <i>things</i> and <i>words</i> can be obtained
only by reading and hearing. We ought to read the best writings and hear
the best orators. And much reading and hearing will not only furnish a
stock of words: it will stimulate independent thought, and will show the
student actual examples of the theoretical principles taught in the
schools.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec16">16-19.</a>
The comparative advantages of hearing and reading: the former more
‘catching,’ the latter more independent.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec20">20-26.</a>
The best writers should be read first. Reading ought to be slow and
searching, with careful attention (especially in the case of speeches)
to details, followed by a review of the whole. We should also acquaint
ourselves with the facts of the cases to which the speeches relate, and
read those delivered on both sides. Other speeches on the same side
should be read, if accessible. But even in studying a masterpiece our
admiration must always be tempered with judgment: we cannot assume the
perfection of every part. It is safer, however, to err on the side of
appreciation: uncritical approbation is preferable to continual
fault-finding.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec27">27-30.</a>
The study of Poetry is important for the orator, as conferring a greater
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
elevation of spirit and diction, besides serving as a pleasurable
recreation. But poetry is not restrained by the practical aims of the
orator, whose stage is a battle-field where he must ever strive for the
mastery.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec31">31-34.</a>
History, too, will furnish a rich and genial aliment, which should be
used, however, with caution: its very excellences are often defects in
the orator. It tells its story, and recalls the past; whereas the orator
must address himself to immediate proof. Considered as a mine of ancient
precedents, history is very useful; but this point of view is rather
outside the scope of the present chapter.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec35">35-36.</a>
Philosophy will give familiarity with the principles of ethics and
dialectics, as well as skill in controversy. But here also we must bear
in mind that the atmosphere of the lecture-room differs from that of the
law-court.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec37">37-42.</a>
In laying down a plan of reading it would be impossible to notice
individually all the writers in both languages, though it may be said
generally that almost all, whether old or new, are worth
reading,&mdash;at least in part. There may be much that is valuable in
relation to some branch of knowledge, but outside my present object,
which is to recommend what is profitable for the formation of style.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec43">43-46.</a>
Before proceeding to give a list of typical authors, a&nbsp;word must be
said about the different opinions and tastes of orators and critics
regarding the various schools and styles of eloquence. Some are
prejudiced in favour of the old writers; others admire the affectation
and refinement which characterise those of our own day. And even those
who desire to follow the true standard of style differ among each other.
The list now to be given contains only a selection of the best models:
it does not profess to be exhaustive.</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec46">§§ 46-61.</a>
<i>Epic, didactic, pastoral, elegiac, iambic, and lyric poetry
proper.</i></p>

<p>The praise of Homer, §§46-51: ‘it is much to understand, impossible
to rival, his greatness.’ Hesiod is rich in moral maxims, and a master
of the ‘middle style’: Antimachus, Panyasis, Apollonius, Aratus,
Theocritus, and others, §§52-57. A&nbsp;word in passing about the
elegiac poets, represented by Callimachus and Philetas, §58. Of
<i>iambographi</i> the typical writer is Archilochus, §§59-60. The chief
lyric poets are Pindar (§61), Stesichorus (§62), Alcaeus (§63), and
Simonides (§64).</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec65">§§ 65-72.</a>
<i>Dramatic poetry.</i></p>

<p>The Old Comedy (§§65-66) with its pure Attic diction and freedom of
political criticism is more akin to oratory and more fitted to form the
orator than any other class of poetry,&mdash;always excepting Homer.</p>

<p>Tragedy (§§67-68) is represented by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides: of the latter two Euripides is more useful for the orator. He
was imitated by Menander (§§69-72), the ‘mirror of life,’ who might
alone suffice to form the orator. Menander’s superiority to all other
comic dramatists.</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#commI_grk_hist">§§ 73-75.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Greek Historians.</span></p>

<p>The pregnant brevity of Thucydides, the charm and transparency of
Herodotus. Theopompus: Philistus (‘the little Thucydides’): Ephorus, and
others.</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#commI_grk_orat">§§ 76-80.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Greek Orators.</span></p>

<p>Demosthenes the standard of eloquence, in whom there is nothing
either too
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
much or too little. Aeschines more diffuse: ‘more flesh, less muscle.’
Hyperides is pleasing, but more at home in less important causes. Lysias
resembles a clear spring rather than a full river. Isocrates belongs to
the gymnasium rather than to the field of battle: in arrangement
punctilious to a fault. Demetrius of Phalerum the last Athenian worthy
of the name of orator.</p>

<p><a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#commI_grk_phil">§§ 81-84.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Greek Philosophers.</span></p>

<p>Both in respect of reasoning power and for beauty of style, Plato
holds the first place. Of Xenophon’s artless charm it might be said that
‘Persuasion herself perched upon his lips.’ Aristotle is famous alike
for knowledge, productiveness, grace of style, invention, and
versatility. Theophrastus owed even his name to the divine splendour of
his language. The Stoics were the champions of virtue, and showed their
strength in defending their tenets: the grand style they did not
affect.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec85">85-92.</a>
<i>Epic Poets.</i></p>

<p>Vergil must head the list, ranking nearer to Homer than any third
poet does to him. For consistent and uniform excellence he may surpass
even Homer, however little he may rival Homer’s best passages. Macer and
Lucretius are worth reading, but not for style. Varro Atacinus has some
merit as a translator, but will not add to an orator’s resources. Ennius
is like some venerable grove, whose trees have more sanctity than
beauty: there are others nearer our own day, and more useful for our
special purpose. Ovid is uncontrolled even in his hexameters, and lets
his fancy run away with him: yet admirable in parts. Cornelius Severus
fell away from the standard of his first book. The youthful works of
Serranus display great talent and a correct taste in style. We lately
lost much in Valerius Flaccus. The inspiration of Saleius Bassus also
failed to take on the mellowness of age. Rabirius and Pedo are worth
reading in spare moments. Lucan has fire and point, and is a model for
orators rather than for poets. Domitian I would name had not the care of
the world prevented him from becoming our greatest poet. Even the
compositions of his earlier days, after he had handed over the empire,
are lofty, learned, and of surpassing excellence: ‘the poet’s ivy is
entwined with the conquering bay.’</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec93">93-96.</a>
<i>Elegy, Satire, iambic and lyric poetry.</i></p>

<p>In Elegy we can challenge the Greeks. The most polished and refined
is, in my opinion, Tibullus; some prefer Propertius. Ovid is more
uncontrolled than either, Gallus harsher. Satire is all our own.
Lucilius is by some still preferred to all poets whatsoever.
I&nbsp;deprecate such extravagant eulogy, as I disagree with the censure
of Horace. Lucilius has learning, boldness, causticity, wit. Horace is
the prince of satirists. Persius earned renown by a single book. Others
still alive will have a name hereafter. Terentius Varro wrote
<i>saturae</i> of the earlier kind. A&nbsp;profound scholar,
antiquarian, and historian, he has made greater contributions to
knowledge than to oratory. As a separate form of composition, iambic
poetry is not much in vogue. Horace is our great lyric
poet,&mdash;everywhere pleasing and graceful, and very happy in his
language. Caesius Bassus too may be added: but there are living authors
of greater merit.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec97">97-100.</a>
<i>Dramatic Poetry.</i></p>

<p>Of Tragedians, Attius and Pacuvius are most renowned for weight of
thought
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
and style, and for the dignity of their characters; but they lack
finish. Attius has more strength, Pacuvius more learning. Varius’s
<i>Thyestes</i> may be set beside any Greek play. Ovid’s <i>Medea</i>
shows what he might have done if he could have kept within bounds.
Pomponius Secundus is by far the greatest of all whom I have myself
seen. Comedy is not our strong point. Notwithstanding Plautus,
Caecilius, and Terence, we scarcely reproduce a faint shadow of our
originals: perhaps our language is incapable of the grace and charm
which, even in Greek, is peculiar to the Attic. Afranius is the best
writer of <i>togatae</i>, but his is not a pure art.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody1.html#chapI_sec101">101-104.</a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Roman Historians.</span></p>

<p>In history we hold our own. Sallust may be pitted against Thucydides,
Livy against Herodotus. Livy is remarkable for the charm and
transparency of his narrative style, as well as for the eloquence and
appropriateness of his speeches; and in the presentation of passion,
especially on its softer side, he is unsurpassed. Sallust is different
but not inferior. Servilius Nonianus wants conciseness. Aufidius Bassus
did more to maintain the dignity of history. There is also the glory of
our own age, the historian who is still with us, and whom I do not
mention by name. Cremutius Cordus is appreciated for his independent
spirit, which still survives in his works in spite of the revision and
expurgation they have been subjected to. There are others, but I am only
giving samples of classes, not ransacking libraries.</p>

<p>Cicero can stand against Demosthenes. I&nbsp;do not propose, however,
to make a detailed comparison between them, and I admit that Demosthenes
is worthy of being learnt by heart. In invention they resemble each
other: in style they differ, Demosthenes being more concise, Cicero more
diffuse; the one always pierces with the point of his weapon, the other
often lets you feel the weight of it; the one has more art, the other a
greater natural gift. In wit and pathos Cicero excels. Demosthenes was
perhaps debarred from glowing perorations; but on the other hand the
genius of the Latin language denies to us a full measure of the peculiar
‘Attic charm.’ Still Demosthenes came first, and Cicero owes much to
him. He is however no mere imitator,&mdash;‘no cistern of rain-water,
but a living source.’ Instructive, affecting, pleasing, he carries his
audience away with him. He wins conviction not by the zeal of a
partisan, but by the impartiality of a judge: everything he does is
natural and easy. He was king of the bar in his own day, and with us his
name is a synonym for eloquence: it is a mark of progress to have a high
appreciation of Cicero. Pollio, with all his good points, is so far
behind Cicero in charm and polish that it might be thought he lived a
century earlier. Messalla is lucid and distinguished, but wants force.
Caesar might have disputed the palm with Cicero; his speeches breathe
his warlike ardour, and yet he is above all things ‘elegans.’ Caelius
has genius and wit: he deserved a longer life. Calvus is by some
preferred to all others; but Cicero thought that by too rigorous
self-criticism he lost the very life-blood of style. He is moral,
weighty, chastened, and often vigorous withal. He was a strict Atticist;
and it is a pity that he died so young, if there was a likelihood of his
enriching his style. Servius Sulpicius made a name by three speeches.
Cassius Severus wants tone and dignity: he has genius, causticity, and
wit; but his anger outruns his judgment. Of those whom I have seen, Afer
and Africanus rank highest: the
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
former might be classed with the orators of former days, the latter is
more vigorous, but careless, wordy, and over-bold in metaphor. Trachalus
has elevation; he had great personal advantages as well. Vibius Crispus
is delightful, but more fitted for private than for public cases. Iulius
Secundus did not live long enough to secure his due share of fame. He is
too much of an artist and too little of a fighting-man: yet he has
fluency, lucidity, and other good qualities. Our own era will furnish
the future historian with many subjects of eulogy.</p>

<p>Though we are not strong in philosophy, yet here the universal Tully
is a match for Plato. Brutus, too, is greater here than in oratory: he
speaks from the heart. Celsus has written a considerable number of
works. Among the Stoics, Plautus will be of service to the inquirer.
Catius the Epicurean has no great weight, but is pleasant withal.
I&nbsp;might have mentioned Seneca before, and in every department, but
have purposely kept him waiting: I&nbsp;am accused of disliking him. The
fact is that at a time when he alone was studied I strove to introduce a
purer taste. He disparaged the ‘ancients,’ and his imitators aggravated
his defects. He possessed wide learning, though on special subjects he
was sometimes misled by others. His versatility is shown in oratory,
poetry, letters, and dialogues. A&nbsp;stern moralist, but a vicious,

of the praise of those of riper years. Yet these too may find profit in

Of Imitation.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec1">1-3.</a>
While the command of words, figures, and arrangement is to be acquired
by the study of the best authors, as recommended in the foregoing
chapter, the mind must also be exercised in the imitation of all the
good qualities which such authors exemplify. The place of imitation in
art: a&nbsp;natural and universal instinct. The very ease of imitation
has its dangers.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec4">4-13.</a>
Only a dull and sluggish spirit will be content to do nothing but
imitate, without inventing anything new. With our advantages of
training, we are even more bound than our predecessors to progress. We
ought even to surpass our models: if we confine ourselves to imitation
alone, shall we ever realise the ideal in oratory? Nature herself does
not achieve exact resemblance in reproduction. Moreover, there is much
in oratory that is characteristic of individual speakers, and due to
natural gifts: this cannot be made matter of imitation. You may imitate
the language and rhythmical arrangement of a great speech; but the
fashion of words changes, and as for arrangement, there must always be
an adaptation of sound to sense.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec14">14-18.</a>
Imitation is therefore a part of study in regard to which great
circumspection must be used,&mdash;first in the choice of models, and,
secondly, in determining
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
the good points we would seek to reproduce; for even good authors have
their defects. Again, we must know the difference between superficial
imitation and that in which the inner spirit is represented. In cases
where only the outward manner is caught elevation becomes bombast, and
simplicity carelessness; roughness of form and insipidity in substance
pass for antique plainness; want of polish and point, for Attic
restraint; artificial obscurity claims to rank above Sallust and
Thucydides; the dull and spiritless challenge comparison with Pollio;
easy-going drawlers call their diffuse periods Ciceronian, delighted if
they can finish off a sentence with <i>Esse videatur</i>.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec19">19-21.</a>
The student must consider which models his own gifts qualify him to
imitate. A&nbsp;bold rugged style, for example, is appropriate to the
form of genius which would make shipwreck by an excessive affectation of
refinement. It is of course within the province of the teacher to supply
the natural defects of his pupils; but it is a far harder matter to
mould and form one’s own nature. Even the teacher will not keep up a
prolonged struggle against obstacles of natural disposition.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec21">21-26.</a>
In oratory we ought not to imitate the characteristic qualities of poets
and historians, and <i>vice versa</i>: each kind of composition has its
own appropriate laws. Let us imitate what is common to eloquence in all
its manifestations. We must adapt our style to the topic and occasion:
even different parts of one and the same speech call for different
treatment. And we should not blindly follow any one model
exclusively.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapII_sec27">27-28.</a>
Imitation must not be confined to words only: we should study also
propriety, arrangement, exordium, narrative, argument, pathos, &amp;c.
The perfect orator, whom our age may hope to see, will be he who shall
unite all the good qualities of his predecessors and reject all the
bad.</p>

How to Write.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec1">1-4.</a>
<i>Introductory to the three chapters on Writing: chs. iii. and iv.
treating of the manner of writing</i> (quomodo), <i>and ch. v. of the
matter and form of writing</i> (quae maxime scribi oporteat §4). The pen
is the best teacher: write much and carefully. Writing is a fundamental
part of the orator’s training.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec5">5-18.</a>
As to the manner of writing, it should at first be deliberate and slow,
with careful attention alike to subject-matter, language, and the
arrangement of words and phrases. And the whole must be subjected to
careful revision, especially if it is written in a glow, as it were, of
inspiration. ‘Write quickly, and you will never write well; write well,
and in time you will write quickly.’ In the case of the orator it is
advisable gradually to accelerate the pace: he will never be able to
overtake his professional duties unless he gets rid of the habit of
carping self-criticism. Story of Iulius Florus. Judgment is also
necessary, as well as practice, if we are to write naturally and clearly
in any given circumstances. The
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
evil results of hasty composition can seldom be undone even by much
verbal correction. Your work should be done with so much care from the
first that it may need only to be filed and chiselled, not recast.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec19">19-27.</a>
Condemnation of the fashionable practice of dictating to an amanuensis.
He who writes for himself, no matter how rapidly, takes time to think;
but your scribe hurries you on, while shame forbids you to pause. Such
compositions reflect neither a writer’s care nor a speaker’s animation:
your one idea is to ‘keep going.’ Besides, an awkward scribe will check
the current of your thoughts. And how absurd it is to have him looking
on at the gestures which often accompany and stimulate the process of
cogitation! On the other hand, while silence and solitude are helpful,
rural seclusion and attractive scenery cannot be said to favour
concentration: closed doors are better. Night hours are the best, but
only in moderation.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIII_sec28">28-30.</a>
But solitude cannot always be secured: those who cannot command it must
habituate themselves to rise superior to every distraction. They who
only study when in the humour will never want an excuse for idleness. It
is possible to think, and to prepare for debate, in a crowd, on a jury,
and even amid the noise and confusion of the law-courts.</p>

The three parts of revision are addition, excision, and alteration. It
is best to lay aside for a time what has been written: an interval after
each new birth will furnish the best safeguard against excessive
parental fondness.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapIV_sec3">3-4.</a>
But time is not always at command. There must obviously be some limit to
revision, especially on the part of the orator, who has to meet the
needs of the moment. Not all changes are improvements: let the file
polish the work, instead of rubbing it all away.</p>

What to Write.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec1">1-8.</a>
The question now, as distinguished from the preliminary courses laid
down in Books i. and ii., is what form of composition we should practise
in order to acquire copiousness and readiness. First, translation from
the Greek: this exercise leaves the writer free to choose the best terms
in his own language.
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
Second, reproduction (or paraphrase) of Latin poets and orators: here,
however, we often have to borrow from our models. Prose renderings of
the poets are especially useful for the formation of an elevated style.
And even in reproducing orations, we are stimulated to a kind of rivalry
with our author, which may result in our surpassing him: in any case,
the difficulty of competing with masterpieces forces us to study them
minutely.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec9">9-11.</a>
It will be of advantage also to put our own ideas into various forms of
expression, and to cultivate the faculty of amplifying: power is shown
in making much of little.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec11">11-16.</a>
Here the writing of <i>theses</i> (or discussions of abstract questions)
forms a valuable exercise: also judicial decisions and commonplaces. The
writing of declamations, or school speeches on fictitious cases, is also
to be recommended, even for those who are already making a name at the
bar. History, dialogue, and poetry are all valuable by way of variety
and recreation: a&nbsp;many-sided culture is the best safeguard against
such intellectual narrowness as would otherwise result from the daily
battles of the law-courts.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec17">17-20.</a>
Young students must not be kept too long at these preparatory exercises,
lest by indulging the fancy overmuch they unfit themselves for practice.
After a youth has been well schooled in <i>inventio</i> and
<i>elocutio</i>, and has had also some moderate amount of practice, he
should attach himself to some eminent public speaker, and accompany him
to the courts: he should write speeches, too, at home on the causes he
has heard. He has no longer to fence with foils.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapV_sec21">21-23.</a>
Declamations should resemble real speeches: the subject should be
treated naturally and thoroughly. Large classes and the custom of public
speech-days tend to encourage a specious showiness, in which only the
most popular and attractive parts of a subject are dealt with, and
crowded together without regard to logical connection. One subject,
thoroughly handled, is worth twenty superficially treated.</p>

Of Meditation.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVI_sec1">1-4.</a>
Meditation occupies the middle ground between writing and improvisation,
and is perhaps more frequently employed than either. <i>After</i> we
have formed our style by the constant practice of writing, meditation
can be cultivated by progressive exercise to such a degree that an
entire discourse may be prepared and arranged without the use of the
pen.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVI_sec5">5-7.</a>
But the orator is not to adhere so scrupulously to what he has thought
out as to reject new ideas which may flash upon him during the actual
delivery of a speech. Meditation should secure us, on the one hand, from
ever being at a loss: on the other it ought not to prevent us from
improving the opportunity afforded by some incidental occurrence. If we
are to hesitate, painfully recollecting what we have formulated in
thought, it were better to trust wholly to improvisation.
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
While we are at a loss to recall our prepared thoughts, we miss others
suggested by the subject itself, which always offers a wider field than
can possibly be covered by previous meditation.</p>

Of Extempore Speech.</span></h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec1">1-4.</a>
The richest fruit of study is the ability to speak effectively on the
spur of the moment: this is in fact absolutely indispensable. ‘An
advocate who proffers help, and fails at the pinch, is a harbour
accessible only in calm weather.’ Cases may take unforeseen turns: like
ship-pilots we must change our tack with each shifting breeze. Unless
the faculty of improvisation can be attained by practice, our years of
labour will have been wasted.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Certain Practical Exercises<br>
conducive to Success in Extempore Speech.</h5>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec5">5-7.</a>
(1) The student must arrange his matter in appropriate order,&mdash;not
only the order of the regular <i>partes</i> or divisions (i.e.
introduction, narrative, proof, refutation, conclusion), and the order
of the principal points, but also the order of the matter and thought in
all its detail, under every head and in every passage (quoque loco). The
sequence of events will be our guide. Knowing what to look for at each
point of our discourse, we shall not be found skipping from one topic to
another; and in the end we shall reach the goal.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec7">7-10.</a>
(2) Reading, writing, and speaking must receive unremitting attention,
and be made the subjects of scientific exercise. The conscientious
practice of writing will give even our extemporary speeches something of
the deliberate character of written compositions. It is practice that
makes the ready speaker. A&nbsp;certain natural quickness of mind is
necessary to look beyond what we are saying at the moment; but neither
nature nor art will enable the mind to keep before itself at one time
the whole of a speech, with all its arguments, arrangement, expression,
&amp;c. As our tongue advances, our thoughts must still outstrip it.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec11">11-14.</a>
(3) Hence the necessity of a mechanical and unscientific habit or
‘knack,’ such as that by which the hand moves in writing, the eye in
reading, and the juggler in his legerdemain. But this knack, though
mechanical, should have a basis of scientific method: otherwise it will
be mere ranting, such as you may hear in abundance from female scolds.
A&nbsp;sudden outburst is often, however, more effective than the result
of study and premeditation.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec15">15-17.</a>
(4) The extemporary speaker must cultivate a lively imagination, that
his mind may be deeply impressed by all the facts of a particular case.
It is the heart that makes the orator. He must also have distinctly in
view not only the end at which he aims but the whole pathway that leads
to it: he will derive incitement even from the presence of his
audience.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec18">18-23.</a>
(5) Extemporary facility can only be attained by the same gradual and
patient course as has been referred to in connection with meditation.
The orator is often debarred from preparation; but as a rule he should
not presume so far on his ability as not to take a moment to glance
mentally at the heads of his discourse,&mdash;which is generally
possible in a court of law. Some declaimers will argue at once on any
topic, and will even ask for a word to begin with: this is foolishness.
If on any occasion we are under the necessity of speaking offhand, we
should pay more attention to our subject-matter than to our language,
and we may gain time by deliberate articulation. Gradually we shall be
able to trim our sails, and pray for a favouring breeze.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec24">24-29.</a>
Continual practice is essential for improvisation. We should speak daily
before an audience whose good opinion we respect; but alone, rather than
not at all. If we do not speak to others, we can always at least go over
our subject-matter in silent thought. This fosters exactness in
composition even more than speaking aloud does; for there we hurry
onward from fear of wearying the audience. On the other hand speaking
exercises the voice and gives the opportunity of practising delivery.
Our language should always be careful and correct, but it is constant
writing that will add most weight to our words, especially if we are
obliged to speak much extempore. In fact, writing gives exactness to
speech, speech readiness to writing. If we cannot write, we can
meditate: if we can do neither, we must still contrive to make a
creditable appearance.</p>

<p>§§ <a href = "files/QuintBody2.html#chapVII_sec30">30-33.</a>
A&nbsp;common habit with barristers in large practice is to write the
exordium and most essential parts, formulate the rest in thought, and
meet any unforeseen turns as they arise. The note-books of Cicero and
Servius Sulpicius. It is advisable to refresh one’s memory by consulting
notes. To prepare an abstract, arranged by heads, of a speech which we
have written out entire, leads us to rely too little on the memory, and
makes the speech broken and awkward in delivery. We ought not to write a
speech out at length unless we intend to commit it to memory. But of
memory more in the following book (XI. ch.&nbsp;ii.).</p>
